 plagiarism this source  which is from medieval italy  an encyclopedia  ed  christopher kleinhenz  has been plagiarized  or nearly so  in a version of this article  take this old version of the article as a reference point  and compare the following  emphasis added by me dionigi di borgo san sepolcro  born circa died was from sansepolcro near arezzo wikipedia  dionigi  c was born in sansepolcro  near arezzo medieval italy he was an augustinian scholar of very keen intellect and was much sympathetic towards others wikipedia  he entered the augustinian order at a young age and immediately distinguished himself by his keen intellect and piety medieval italy dionigi was a scholar trained as an astrologer in sorbonne as well as a theologian  he received his doctorate circa wikipedia  he studied theology at the sorbonne in paris and received his doctorate c medieval italy one of dionigi s works  which since has been lost  is his commentary  circa on valerius maximus s factorum et dictorum memorabilium libri wikipedia  almost all of dionigi s own writing has been lost  his most famous work is his commentary  probably c on valerius maximus s factorum et dictorum memorabilium libri medieval italy it became a template for subsequent commentaries on valerius maximus and also for several of boccaccio s reference works such as esposizioni and genealogia deorum gentilium  wikipedia  this commentary  with its many citations of classical authors  became a template not only for subsequent commentaries on valerius maximus but also for several of boccaccio s nonfictional works  such as esposizioni and genealogia deorum gentilium medieval italy another of dionigi s writings is a commentary on the first book of the sententiae  a treatise on logic  and still another is a commentary on the pseudo aristotelian oeconomia wikipedia dionigi s other writings include a commentary on the first book of the sententiae  a treatise on logic  and a commentary on the pseudo aristotelian oeconomia medieval italy and that s just the first two paragraphs of that version of the wp article  in my opinion  this is a clear cut case of plagiarism and a violation of copyright  some of this remains in the article  some has been altered  but there s obviously a larger concern of whether there are other instances of plagiarism in the article  i m not sure how to proceed  ,0

  in an interpreted language your source code is read in command by command by a software tool  which is called the interpreter and executed what command by command no interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays  taw from interpreted language talk some languages  like perl  are compiled at runtime  could you elaborate taw  every time a perl script is run  perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code  at least  this is the usual way of using perl  although it s not the only way  zundark dec you mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code taw i believe it s compiled to bytecode  much like java  as of perl version it s possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step  i think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well  but i m not as sure about that  indigo perl  http w indigoperl com  produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable  but i think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode  so they tend to be rather large  their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don t necessarily have the perl interpreter installed they have versions for both windows and unix ish platforms wesley old interpreted language article an interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code  but is interpreted at run time by the computer  and  trans lated into machine understandable code as required it is often a mistake to refer to a language as either interpreted or compiled because most languages can be implemented in either way  and some languages  like perl  are compiled at runtime but behave as if they were interpreted  other languages  like java  may be partially compiled into an intermediate form which is then interpreted  although that  too  might be compiled some languages  though  are specifically designed to favor interpretation an example of an interpreted language is javascript is java interpreted  or what the java programming language article says the first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability  and many implementations still do  these implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully compiled programs created by the typical c compiler and some later java language compilers  so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs  more recent implementations of the java vm produce programs that run much faster  using multiple techniques  the java language is compiled  always it is designed as a compiled language  and is implemented as a compiled language it is often compiled into bytecode  which is then interpreted  with a virtual machine i think the java language article is correct  but maybe it could be worded better ldc  yes  and you can also compile jave straight down to machine code if you like  the above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is imho incorrect  every language that has an eval statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code  you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code  axelboldt  way too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of compiling it is used in two distinct meanings  as in compiled to machine code  or assembly compiled to byte code parse tree some other internal representation  i think it s wrong to call languages that use the second way compiled in such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use no language uses line by line parsing nowadays  all compile source to some form of internal representation quote from foldoc compiler a program that converts another program from some  source language or  programming language to machine language object code some compilers output assembly language  which is then converted to  machine language  by a separate  assembler ,0

 what are you talking about  you were never even un simperingly polite  starting with your sarcastic comments as you reverted my changes  also  as you were unable to see in your two minute glance  dea special agent names are given throughout that document  the americans don t have an equivalent of the official secrets act  though the bu shit es have been clamoring for one  true  i won t learn anything else from the documents  but other people might  and there could be more discussion in the country about them  the dea memo is archived at many other places  and the israeli art students are mentioned in many places besides that site  the geocities site neatly collects the relevant materials in one location  i know very well what mathematical logic is  it s just that you don t use any of the normal kind  your bloated sense of self importance and propensity for snap judgements about matters on which you are completely ignorant show that even if it s true that you re an adult  unlikely you have the emotional maturity of a year old  as i said before  i am not an evangelist for this issue  so i will now leave you alone to celebrate your brilliant mind  hope mommy and daddy got you all the toys you wanted today  ,0

 strange  i was almost sure that karen ryan is a pen name of william mauco  as part of the article igor smirnov  pridnestrovie s khozyain president from tiraspol times is copied word by word from the article khozyain from wikipedia  which was writen by william mauco  only after that was discovered started mauco to write officially in tiraspol times with the name william maurice  comparison wikipedia s khozyain  stub written by mauco july khozyain is a russian term often used to describe a certain type of political leader  it is rich term which traditionally refers to a leader of a given social domain  a home  a village  an enterprise  or a country  the khozyain of a household is usually the oldest male and is entrusted with the welfare of the group  for someone to merit the title of a real khozyain he must take care of those in his domain  russians tend to judge leaders  including politicians  on whether they are  or give the impression of being  a real khozyain  they are sometimes hard to classify in a classical political sense since their overriding concerns are not a leftist or rightist political agenda  but the welfare of the group where ideology is less important than pragmatism  strength of character and problem solving skills  a person who displays talents in this direction is called a khozyaistvennik  a khozyain politician can easily be seen as authoritarian in a western political context  a more accurate description would be to classify him as a father figure  examples of khozyain politicians  yuri luzhkov and igor smirnov article in tiraspol times by karen ryan september part the khozyain president khozyain is a russian term often used to describe a certain type of political leader  the prototype of the style of igor smirnov  pridnestrovie s own khozyain head of state  it is a rich term which traditionally refers to a leader of a given social domain  a home  a village  an enterprise  or a country  the khozyain of a household is usually the oldest male and is entrusted with the welfare of the group  for someone to merit the title of a real khozyain he must take care of those in his domain  russian voters judge leaders  including politicians  on whether they are  or give the impression of being  a real khozyain  they are sometimes hard to classify in a classical political sense since their overriding concerns are not a leftist or rightist political agenda  but the welfare of the group where ideology is less important than pragmatism  strength of character and problem solving skills  igor smirnov and the other founding fathers of the republic have declared on many occasions  from the earliest day of the independence struggle  that what they wanted to create was a society free of isms  a khozyain politician can easily be seen as authoritarian in a western political context  and  true to form  igor smirnov has been called both a strongman and  by the more radical smirnov  hate rs in moldova  a dictator a more accurate description  for those who understand the true meaning of the word khozyain  would be to classify him as a father figure what is sure is that mauco is pushing everywhere in wikipedia tiraspol times  not only here but in any  trans nistria related page  in an other article he was against the linking to a russian press agency  he started edit war to include his beloved tt  probabily he has good reasons for loving it  but i m still confused  who is william mauco  william maurice or karen ryan ,0

 liaison with brian epstein  this link talks about orton forming a liaison with a prominent manager of a well known music team at that time and it would have been a wonderful combination  apparently halliwell had found out about it and beat joe to death with a hammer two weeks later  sad to relate  the new found friend of joe orton committed suicide already  one thinks of the beatles and their manager brian epstein add the fact that epstein did kill himself on august just over weeks after orton s murder  and it s clear who they re talking about but they don t name him can this be corroborated anywhere talk ,0

 he also wrote  agapetos angel s behavior has been fair  conscientious  and courteous in everything i observed  i have not surveyed all of this editor s contributions so there may be things i haven t seen  based on my interaction i would rate this person as an above average editor  responsive to feedback  willing and able to act in the interests of fairness this leap to arbitration appears precipitous  isn t it normal procedure to begin with mediation or a user rfc  i certainly know other editors whose behavior has been far more inappropriate  who i wish were in arbitration  unless there is something about wikipedia procedure i don t understand  there seems to be nothing in these mild accusations to justify having bypassed several less severe methods of dispute resolution  the speed with which this proceeding has reached this stage has the appearance of impropriety  some of the editors involved in the dispute at jonathan sarfati are administrators  i don t know whether this represents actual influence or prejudicial treatment  but this proceeding gives a strong whiff of something like that  no particular dispute is important enough to compromise an admin s reputation for impartiality ,0

in trans itive strategies it seems that this page needs to mention the case when strategies are in trans itive in the number game for example  a comparison of vs would give an additional equilibrium of but choosing and this situation seems to apply to several cases such as the traveler s dilemma and centipede game where the nash equilibrium is not the result of play and not the best strategy i don t know of any references and am not educated in game theory  but explicitly addressing this could make these cases where the nash equilibrium is not chosen much less confusing ,0

 personnaly  i wouldn t complain if v single handedly reworked the article and actually made it better  i would complain  however  and i would accuse him of dominating it if  as usual  he reworked the article only in order to put his own views and theories into the article or if he adopted a non encyclopedical style  only to start yet another edit war if anyone dared to touch his holy contributions  i would complain if v tried again to threaten me to force me out of wikipedia for standing in his way ie respecting the no or policy and indeed  if v were to do that  i would consider it downgrading the article  and article ownership  because that is what v is doing here  so he can touch w hate ver article he wants  but any violations of the rules will be reverted  and i m tired of seeing him throw tantrums everywhere about people destroying his work when he s obviously determined to have his own way on wp and to ignore every existing guideline and policy  and to attack everyone reminding him that articles about evangelion don t belong to him  ,0

  well thank you  i am glad that at least you can really look at existing articles  and realise a mistake has been made somewhere and apologise for it  and for that  i shall rest my case  as for the part over the assumption of good faith  perhaps i may just remind  that your introductory comment in my talk page  as well as the revert edit summary you provided are just as inflammatory and a reflection of bad faith to me in my books  and you may similarly wish to reflect a little on how you conduct your edits  to revert another purely due to the unnecessarily terse edit summary is simply unacceptable in wikipedia  if you have an issue with my comment  talk it out in the relevant talk page  and i would prefer it to be either in the article s talk page itself or in a more centralised location  this is not some kind of a you vs i issue alone  others should know what happens in the background too  this is a community  remember not revert out of emotional displeasure or just to make a point  that you are suspicious of my edits based on past experience in other articles does not vindicate your current action  it speaks of nothing but very bad faith  so you may perhaps do good cleaning up your backyard first before telling others what to do  reminds me very much of global politics for some reason  d my comments are unbelievably inflammatory  well i am sorry  but i do happen to be someone who usually speaks my mind  and i dont mince my words  you will have to get used to my bluntness  i suppose  as much as i have to get used to your behavior as well the last i checked  you created the three articles for alliancesm  with na at the top for each of them  now please explain to me in what way is na the home continent for each airline alliance  co  for your information  was created by me way back on december and it started off with an alphabetical listing  and it has remained that way until february when you unilaterally came along and changed the other  callig it standardization no one said anything about it after this change  well i did  and almost immediately  i dont see any avidence of the continent order being switched back and forth at any time of its edit history  and i certainly do not see anyone commenting on the pre existing alphabetical listing for a good months straight even when na is co s home continent so now that we know just what exactly is being standardised here  are you going to apply them to the three articles you created ,0

jill kristin mccormick is a fictional character made up mostly by vedder himself and materially developed by pearl jam s pr machinery vanderberg communications managed by nicole vanderberg  the fact that mccormick s birth date was changed can prove a point that data for this article is arbitrarily written with no real verifiable data source or document to support it  the person who poses for this personality is actually named kathy davis  a cousin of eddie vedder s  who also pretends to be his spouse but is actually the girlfriend of pearl jam fan club manager tim bierman  also one needs to check the information on her children  they are not vedder s but bierman s  no reliable source supports the claim that vedder is actually the father  this therefore makes the all of the information details on this person with regards to this article questionable ,0

i think part of wikipedia is defining what a term means  many words are used in many different ways  i remember  ethnic group  being a pretty vague term before wikipedia was around  everyone uses the word  evolution  in a different way  i don t believe in  correct  definitions so much as consistent and useful ones  i propose we adopt the following evolution  umbrella term  any change over time  as stated in first sentence of article natural selection  horizontal gene  trans fer  etc mechanisms which explain evolution  the observation theories of evolution  a theory to explain one particular facet of evolution in terms of natural history  e g  out of africa theory  cretaceous paleogene extinction event  the other problem with this article is that many scientists were motivated by a desire to explain why livings things are adapted to their environment or to explain the diversity of life  as opposed to evolution per se the precambrian rabbit wouldn t falsify evolution so much as discredit all of our current theories about evolution  what do we think ,0

 you incorrectly infer from the agreement to include other pictures that all editors have agreed to delete the photo you propose to delete  there was no consensus to delete the photo  there was your demand that that the photo was unrepresentative and there were other editors acting to find photos to assuage your demands by providing other photos that would meet your demands  that doesn t imply agreement with your demand to delete a factual photo  it is not an explicit expression of consensus  at least on other editor involved in the discussion at that time tareq is disputing your assertion of consensus and i am disputing your claims that the photo is unrepresentative the basis for deleting it  and the existence of your alleged consensus now  the picture of the wall that you want to delete is very significant  it shows the ugliness of the israeli wall  there is no rule that says photos must be representative  a photo is a factual representation of the facts  this is aone part of the wall  deleting it is a form of cesorship of the reality of the wall in at least some places  in any case  how is representativeness determined  your opinion does not suffice  what percentage of the wall is fence and what percent is wall  what is the representative appearance in populated areas  what is considered a representative portion  what are the future final plans for the wall s appearance  the photo will be returned top the article without deleting any other photo  adding information is preferable to deleting information dec utc ,0

 just my thoughts on iti doubt there is a definitive answer that would satisfy everyone  and doubt that it is worth he effort to try to clarify in any great detail in some cases it is probably appropriate  and actually used just like a surname  in a legitimate but different  broader sense than that used by our surname article  and including patronymics in iceland or elsewhere  by the person that s probably especially true of radio personalities with an on air name that is actually two given names but sounds like a given name and a last name  i ve seen that happen quite often and that happens with various other stage names and pen names that are derived from given names but as a general rule  no  some like ann margret make it clear by normally using a hyphen  the problem  of course  is that our articles  especially the stubs and sub stubs  often do not have enough information to make it clear what is going on if it is mary lou or something of the sort  common combinations of given names where the second one is much rarer as a surname  especially if it includes the actual surname in the article itself  it should clearly be under m in any category  the redirect which should be there  or a dummy one if needed because otherwise it would be a disambiguation page  could be categorized if the full name were desired in some categories  and when that is done a note on the article page is helpful but in between  there is a huge variety that you ll likely get some arguments about no matter how it is done a bigger problem is people with full names given in the article name yet indexed under just the first given name in all categories  and there are lots of them  even worse are those easter egg sortings under some nickname which doesn t even appear in the article s own name  ,0

 a broken chair is not a chair a broken chord is not a chord  an inverted pendulum is not a pendulum  never leave out the the inverted in inverted pendulum the problem with small whels and no castor is that the rider had to ride a combined inverted pendulum with gyroscopic forces that inhibit steering and then feed back into speed wobble instability at speed so riding slowly  one can ride the inverted pendulum when riding the penny farthing  one had to slow down  to inverted pendulum speeds to turn  and then one had to be a master at inverted pendulum riding to achieve the turn attempting to overcome gyrscopic force of the penny farthing front wheel while moving at speed was not possible  as the small and lightly loaded rear wheel would not grip and so would not provide enough torque  the small wheel would bounce along and provide very little torque the penny farthing got the large front wheel because the older castor deficient design did not have signficant castor  and were hard to pedal as the pedal  plane  rotated compared to the rider  a real pain  in the legs the safety bike gave the much more leg friendly pedal arrangement plus the castor on the front  wheel removed the problems with turning stability at speed and feed back to the rider  the better pedal arrangement of the safety bike gave the rider better  ability to do the inverted pendulum control at slow speeds  ,0

 along with the evident commitment of wikipedians  i also found wikipedia s numerous policies  guidelines and normative behaviors intimidating to me as a newcomer  kraut and resnick noted that techniques for encouraging voluntary compliance  such as explicitly stating and prominently displaying guidelines  tend to be more effective with insiders who care about the community s health and their own standings within the community  they identified four factors which increase voluntary compliance commitment to the community  legitimacy of norms  the ability to save face  and expectations about rewards for compliance or sanctions for noncompliance  with an underdeveloped sense of commitment to the community  a lack of comprehension regarding the strong community norms  and an expectation of sanctions for noncompliance  i was less likely to be bold  or participate  in the community unless directed to do so  the most paralyzing of these factors was the high probability that norm violations  would  be detected ensured by wikipedia s anyone can edit community design  ,0

 this is not a  trans lation of the greek article  i was looking for good quality articles in foreign languages that we re missing from en wiki  and i did read the greek article  but i did not  trans late any part of it  i was negligibly inspired by the greek article  it is impossible for the majority of the article to have original content since they both cover the same bleeding topic  what would you like me to do  pretend that it lies in the adriatic sea ,0

 re  maccabiah teams i understand what you mean  i myself was somewhat reluctant to add them to that section at first  exactly for the reason you have stated  i think it s a shame  however  to see the maccabiah teams entirely out of the national section of all the templates  it strikes me as slightly misleading  aren t they national teams  after all  don t they compete on an international basis representing their own countries  here s an idea that  i believe  addresses both your and my concerns  the maccabiah teams are included into the national sections  with a small text within parentheses after their names which clarifies that they are not selected by the rugby unions of each country  just like this not chosen by the national rugby union tell me what you think  by the way  thanks for the welcoming message  i appreciate it ,0

let s understand each other sicilianmandolin  the info in the first paragraph is not at all promotional  if you really want to still keep away the info that you deleted  i will accept that  even though i do not understand why  however i will not allow anyone to just delete info in the first paragraph as it is now  it is  as i said  promotional  all first paragraphs of other nations are equally as  promotional as you say  and captivating  wikipedia  i agree  is not a tourist brochure  yet you always include the best achievements of the country in the intro  also  what i mean by  attacking  italy related articles is that many people seem to not want pages to change and there is constant edit wars  reverting and deleting  rather than deleting disputable info  i believe that it is better to improve it  rather than revertion  as i ve only edited a few italian articles  it could be only concerning those pages  but that s what i see in that ok  let s just leave the intro as it is now  if you want sources for the info you deleted  i could go and find some  also  if you look on the italy talk page  you ll see that there is a discussion about adding more info on italy s culture  art and literature  as you said the article needs drastic improvement  your italian knowledge could help our project immensly  reply,0

 re  correlation and dependence article hi again  and well done for registering  regarding the link that you were are wanting to add to the correlation and dependence article  i suggest the following i  you could best make your points for inclusion on the article s talk discussion page  so that others can comment the edit summary and user s talk pages are not good for this ii  you could try to find a place in the article to make some kind of helpful reference to this link s content  that is  an inline citation rather than it just appearing in a bald way under external links so that readers would know that the link is meant to be useful regarding interpretation i  if you feel that this link does have something particularly useful to say  or a good way of looking at things  then you could try to summarise  re state these points within the article itself again you could ask for opinions help on the article s talk page  but there is really no reason why you shouldn t go ahead and add something  my own opinion is that adding plain external links should be avoided once an article has substantial content  a previous editor mentioned linkspam and  while this link might not quite fit within that term  the website itself didn t seem to have a lot of other content  but i could be wrong  and the substantiality of the source has some bearing on whether a link is appropriate if you have an inclination to help in improving the content of the statistics articles more generally you should see wikipedia wikiproject statistics  there is certainly need for help in improving the understandability of all of the statistics articles  so don t be put off if there seems to be an emphasis on mathematical technicalities  ,0

 now how come holmes  a half jamaican born citizen of the uk  is considered more british and notable than say  margaret thatcher  what a load of crap  admit it  this is a pc reflection and nothing else  i could never move to africa or asia  marry  have children and expect my gold medalling athlete children to get posted on a webpage about the chinese and africans  it is simply absurd  we are not allowed an identity  everyone else is  and of course  we have mr  authoritarian snowded arguing that anyone who tries to remove holmes from the article  despite numerous numerous compaints  is a vandal  and he shows his disease when he for some reason feels it is necessary to blab on about ohh  we all came from africa or oh  our to their lands blah blah blah gee  i wonder what is influencing his decisions  guilt  self hatred  it certainly isn t any understanding about the reality of ethnicity i d never donate money to this propaganda machine that is wikipedia  god save britain  not this website of disinformation h  montgomery ,0

 november utc ok  i ve managed to load the reference  the website was apparently down earlier  and i ve checked the equation  oberth uses  c  for the relative exhaust velocity  and slightly weirdly elegantly  he uses a negative number for it  it s a different equation to yours  oberth also takes the time to explain what it all means  whereas you ve just plonked an equation down in the article if you copy his equation better  and fixed up the diagram to match  and explained what the symbols mean  and what the implications are  that would be ok for inclusion ,0
 may utc decline there is a good deal of truth in what you say  and i have no reason to think that the disruptive behaviour will continue now  however  we have to consider not only of now  but of the future  looking at the history of the incident  i see that it was not just an unfortunate reaction on the spur of the moment  in the first instance  it was more than one incident  involving more than one other editor  but also  and more importantly  when your actions were criticised  you persisted in your unconstructive attitude  and  even when given more than enough opportunities to cool down  you chose to continue being defiant  uncivil  and contentious  in view of your history  i do not think that it would convey the right message to show you that you can repeatedly push until you are  block knowing that you will either be given a very short block  or the block will be retracted or shortened as long as you say after the event that you won t do it again anytime soon it is more likely to protect the project in the long run to let you learn that such behaviour will lead to a block which will stick  as that may perhaps encourage you to stop and think before the situation reaches the point of a block  for that reason  i think that in this case escalating blocks are appropriate ,0

to the original topic  kittybrewster  i realize that this is your topic area of greatest interest  but i ve been thinking about a good answer  and the best i can come up with is this  we re both wasting time here  it seems at the end of the day  i m convinced that both you and vintagekits are to blame for a series of wikipedia as battleground incidents  and you do not  from where i sit however  when he went straight to his old battleground  you welcomed him back in kind and the fact is on wiki experienced users are expected to do better than that  some sort of attempt at peacemaking is best  or some sort of dialogue or somesuch  when you ran straight to an admin and then an i to get the topicban reinstated  it showed me that you are not interested  probably because you believe it is impossible  in working together with vintagekits and possibly others who share his viewpoint  you see it as more vintagekits  fault  but from my chair  you re both beyond the cutoff  please remember  my job is to not create parity  equity  equality  or even justice  though i flatter myself and think i can produce it in my own life on occasion  no  i am an administrator not a philosopher king  and at the end of the day wikipedia needs no one  not you  vintagekits  or i  more than it needs a productive working environment as a whole when i was involved with vintagekits  topic ban  at the previous round with the baronets and troubles bans  i can tell you that they worked to great effect  maintaining him in a topic of interest despite his protestations of injustice  i hope you can find something you re interested in as well outside your original main content  try stretching outwards a little perhaps the history of the british parliament as a whole  and our articles on parliamentary procedure need to be updated badly and are americentric  i sincerely hope you good luck in your endeavors ,0

 hs khalsa recommendations i have several suggestions for how the sikhism page can be improved i plan to list them below  one at a time  allowing time for comment on them before making the relevant changes after a suggestion has been considered and approved or rejected  i will move on to my next suggestion the followers of sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten sikh gurus and the select works of fifteen earlier bhagats as scripted in the gur granth sahib  problem  i feel this sentence is misleading as you know  the writings of only six gurus are included in guru granth sahib perhaps this sentence is not meant to suggest that all ten gurus are included however  a second issue arises because there are more authors than just fifteen bhagats included in guru granth sahib as implied by the second part of the sentence  solution the followers of sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten  lowercase  t sikh gurus  as well as  no  the guru granth sahib which includes select works of numerous authors from diverse backgrounds  if this is not detailed enough  perhaps all relevant authors could be listed in any case  just stating fifteen earlier bhagats is factually incorrect further  the emphasis of the gurus was not on the background of the authors  but on what they had to say about god i also propose removing  the  from in front of guru granth sahib guru granth sahib is not a thing it is not acceptable or appropriate to call guru nanak dev the guru nanak  or to call guru gobind singh the guru gobind similarly  guru granth sahib is a guru of equal stature i know writing the guru granth sahib is extremely prevalent all over the web  but we at wikipedia should consider the merits of the case and hold ourselves to higher standards rather than just going with what is most popular thanks for considering my post  ,0

response to jamesbwatson thank you for your reply  your response confirms to me that you have obviously sided with the other users who attacked me  perhaps users such as blixx are good friends of yours  given this then it is impossible for me to get treated fairly as you are apparently biased towards them  i find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing  blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have  block  me from emailing  all because i complained about my treatment  lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen  you just don t like it when i diagree with a point of view  are you following the orders of blixx and co  yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me they have called me  a nasty piece of work an islamist haddad s puppet  etc  have you even warned them  i think not  so its ok for them to make personal attacks on me but when i criticise blixx and co i get punished  one rule for one and one rule for another eh thank you for explaining what the word contraversial means to me  maybe you can explain the meaning of another word for me hypocrite  i want to end by apologising for any offence caused  but you have to understand my frustation at being treated this way ,0

 suspicious mass edits is any administrator following spylab s editing can anybody tell me who gave the right to this guy under the pseudonym spylab to behave like the master of wikipedia  deleting my comment i uploaded yesterday here and ignoring the comments of other users  despite the fact they were based on wikipedia policy  according to which he cannot introduce mass changes to an entry without generating a discussion first in the talk page about the changes he suggested  evidence was produced by other users to show that he lied when he said that he did just a simple copy editing  as it was shown that he deleted sentences  and that he distorted the meaning of other phrases  simply because he has no clue about the inclusive democracy project despite all this  he comes back again and again adding deleting and re organizing at will this entry  has anybody appointed him to do this damaging work  which far from enhancing the significance of wikipedia  it creates the impression that any ignoramus can do w hate ver he likes with long established entries ,1

 i would like to add a stub on the penisula medical school  maybe if and when the block is lifted i can do so but i do not want it linked to a shopping mall can we seperate the two completely its like reading an article on maddison sqaure and finding a  buy viagra in nyc  link stuck in the middle of it  preceding unsigned comment added by talk contribs you would have more credibility if your first of only edits hadn t been to vandalise one of the articles i m working on just like the other trolls and sockpuppets  but to answer your question there s no difficulty in either adding the details to this drake circus article  thereby avoiding the despised drake circus shopping centre article  or by creating a whole new article  you will of course have to meet the wp notability requirements if you choose the latter  of course if you wish to do the former you ll have to wait until the protection runs out  alternatively you can place the details here and an experienced editor will do it for you  i published an article on a poet and then because i also wanted to feature an article on the peninsula medical school in drake circus i came here  i read all that you have deleted over the months and from that i learnt you are not allowed to link to spam so applying your rules i removed the spam link from your article  so you are saying you are the only person allowed to edit an article  and that if anyone dare to remove your spam they are  just like other trolls and sockpuppets i suggest that unless you have anything constructive to say you stop insulting people and go away i have no interest in either where you came from or where you go  when your first edit is to delete something from an article using a spurious excuse like spam then that is vandalism  before you delete anything else from any other article i suggest you bone up on the guidelines first  the requisite article you needed to be aware of for your first edit was wp el  likewise a quick lesson in commonsense would also be handy  i e  a link to a manchester history website in an article about a manchester historical establishment couldn t be construed as spam by any stretch of the imagination  incidentally you created the mo foster article almost an hour after you deleted the spam link  you really need to learn how wp works before trying to game the system  you really need to learn how wp works you mean if some guy tries to publish an article that might compete with one of yours they will be  block  and their article trashed reading through all this i find it hard to believe its all about spam firstly google respects wp s nofollow attribute in the links tabs and secondly they have an index for example of known spammers of for example social networking sites  i personally would like more emphasis in the article on the computer sciences in drake circus as that is what it is becoming more rapidly known for  preceding unsigned comment added by i have no interest in either where you came from or where you go particularly if that just happens to be drake circus  plymouth  preceding unsigned comment added by ,0

 you won t be taken seriously if you can t come up with a source which claims the picture is anything other than what the bbc news article purports it to be  just saying the red cannot any way be from blood is hardly a compelling argument and is clearly original research  find me a reliable source which says image of beit hanoun street with red water in it  definitely no blood and i ll accept that the picture s provenance is in question  however the bbc and afp are clearly reliable sources and what they claim is valid for inclusion in articles  the only question over whether to include them is whether they satisfy the fair use rationale that they add information to the article  i m undecided on this  but i d  hate  to see valuable content not included because some people refuse to trust a clearly reputable news source  ,0

 p s  in response to  canvassing i think such accusations are  once again  biased  we see users such as kittybrewster admit to it  but nothing happens  because she is supporting the status quo  canvassing for the status quo acceptable  canvassing for a minority position unacceptable  this  despite the fact that wikipedia calls for a pluralistic approach that takes multiple viewpoints into account  unless those views represent an extreme margin  and in this case  wikipedia may have erred  from bbc to abc  cambridge university to ucla  my work has been accepted by the very highest echelons in academia and the mainstream media  yet i m being voted off the island by persons such as mla  who doesn t know anything about the field and whose main contributions to wikipedia have bee the creation of mma articles  and this speaks to the larger ills of society itself  not just wikipedia  wikipedia is a tool that reflects society  we still  in the majority  value violence and sports over academic pursuits  football  soccer  basketball players all make much more than college professors  even the best and brightest in the field  thus the problem is not just with wikipedia  but society itself finally again  fyo i am more than two  but slightly less than three  standard deviations above the  average  iq  and therefore i see fit to say that i  like michael c price  and more than two orders of magnitude above the average member of society  even if the average wikipedian is slightly above societal average  we can still see the groundwork of  one  order of magnitude higher  of course  an established wikipedian may be well above the average wikipedia user  so again those comments were not about you personally but about the system  which i see as having quite many flaws  i do hope that these types of  essays  will lead to  constructive  improvements in the future sincerely  robert young ,0

 parker v dc i just looked at my comments  and wikipedia policy be damned doesn t appear there  the policy you cited as an excuse for loading up irrelevant commentary doesn t compel leaving such rubbish in the entry what you re doing is finding materials that regurgitate either the court s dissent or arguments in dissent and posting them under controversy i appreciate not everyone is pleased with the court s decision the place for their arguments is either before the entire circuit court if it grants a hearing  or before the supreme court if it goes there for example  chemerinsky s rejection of the court s plain english decision doesn t deserve a full paragraph  chemerinsky has an argument  the court considered it as proposed by the parties and amici curae  and rejected it  he  and you  should accept that and gear up for the next hearing  if any  basically he argued that the ruling had  no basis in constitutional law your propose long quote adds nothing of substance to that take a look at the article on the second amendment for an example of how to handle it  ,0

hello cielomobile  i have to say that i also belive that the edits made recently to the united states mexico barrier page were not vandalism  i understand that the topic of the border can be polemic  but i don t think that user was vandalizing the page  maybe you could use the talk page talk united states mexico barrier to lay out your objections to those edits without deleting them entirely  i think they were good faith efforts to improve the article  and that is also one of the guiding principles of wikipedia  to assume good faith  it might help though  if the author of those edits were to register with wikipedia so the edits won t appear merely with an ip address ,0

 saying that youtube and ytmnd are not reliable sources for  internet phenomenons  is odd  to say the least  these sites are perhaps the prime sources  along with  chan  for net phenoms  any reliable source would be making their decision based on the prevalence of footage of lazytown on these very sites  lazytown is an internet phenomenon because they are on the very hub of netculture  but to cite the largest sources of net pop culture isnt reliable  that is curcular logic at it s very best  what better indication than looking at fan communities  fan comminity sites are precisely what produce internet cultural phenomenons  go to the source to accept so called reliable sources would cut off quite a few articles that can be considered common knowledge to people who spend a good amount of time on the net  there is a difference in documentaion processes between the the real world and this one  even between wetware and hardware  it seems wiki has not kept up to speed  which is surprising as it was spawned in the web  ,0

 the main things i disagree about the haunted castle post  no one realized that lives had been lost until later that night  when firefighters searching one of the burnt out trailers discovered the bodies  thought at first to be mannequins  this is not true  this was reported in our local papers as well  the night of the fire  the media were told almost nothing  and had to go by rumor  i spoke to the fire chief  as well as numerous others on the scene that night  you see  except for the extreme rear portions of the back of the trailers  where the walls were not made of plywood  everything except metal had been disintegrated to ash  the bodies were discovered before dark  as soon as the fire was extinguished  not much later in the night  the firefighters knew that what they were dealing with were human remains  bones  blood  jew elry and even unburned clothes and wallets inside pockets on those insulated on the bottom of the pile i ve seen the photos  additionally  the stench of burned flesh was overpowering  being noticed by patrons exiting the park from the main exit  separated only by a chain link fence from the haunted castle trailers  wax mannequins would have been long since melted the truth is that the management at first claimed  and might have believed  to firefighters that they had evacuated all patrons from the hc  and there was no reason to close the park  the  castle was isolated  so the fire couldn t spread to other buildings  the fire was out by and the park closed at p m  i ve never heard of sfga kicking everybody of the park during an otherwise fairly busy night  with fair weather with a free return pass  an unprecedented decision was made and implemented in minutes  given this time frame  they clearly found the bodies instantly  and there wasn t time to think that they were mannequins eight days after the fire  a statement by the ocean county prosecutor s office said a year old boy had called the police after hearing radio reports that investigators were looking for witnesses  the boy told the police that he had been befriended by a year old boy at the castle s entrance  he said the older youth  who appeared to be familiar with the castle  offered to guide him through  he said the older youth used a cigarette lighter to find his way down a long corridor that was dark because of a malfunctioning strobe light  and eventually bumped into and ignited a foam rubber wall pad  the prosecutor exonerated the older youth  who has never been identified  of any criminal wrongdoing  police knew the identities of both boys by very early the next morning  and interviewed both saturday may th the younger boy s parents had called authorities without being prompted by any radio broadcast  the older boy was turned in by his teacher  who had seen him unattended  exit a burning haunted castle  and alerted police as soon as he could  this boy set numerous fires  bumping up against the strobe pad could not have accidentally ignited it  try to reproduce such a thing  it takes about seconds to set fire to polyurethane foam  it is unclear why the prosecutor didn t go after him  according to news reports of the trial  no such boy was ever found  and no other witness testified to seeing such a boy  under cross examination by the defense  the witness denied starting the fire himself  although its true as it is quote from the article  the identity of the boy was well known to investigators i think there should be added also be added mention of the name of the ninth person who lived from the ill fated group  the legacy of exploitation and disrespect that has been associated with the property  as well as numerous other facts thanks  ,0

 i never said they would be expelled i said they do not meet the eligibility requirements to be a scout the only way an avowed homo sex  can both understand and agree to live by the scout oath and law is to lie of course  he is also violating his promise to be trustworthy in the process  he does not meet the eligibility requirements to be a scout he intentionally violates the scout oath and law  and he intents to continue violating the scout oath and law but he could join and remain in scouting nonetheless  by telling lies i imagine  at any given time  there are thousands of scouts who are regularly violating the scout oath and law  who intend to continue doing so  and still remain in scouts but that doesn t change the fact the scout oath is what it is  that bsa believes that homo sex  behavior violates the scout oath  and that these scouts are not qualified to be scouts  the first amendment simply does not require that every member of a group agree on every issue in order for the group s policy to be  expressive association the courts may not interfere on the ground that they view a particular expression as unwise or irrational and beliefs need not be acceptable  logical  consistent  or comprehensible to others to merit first amendment protection the fact that many scouts disagree with bsa beliefs  ignore bsa beliefs  disobey bsa beliefs  or that anyone finds bsa beliefs to be inconsistent  irrational  or unwise  does not take away bsa s right to assert and hold their beliefs  ,0

  november utc  your usual obfuscation  there is no reason even to bring up the mathematically complicated natural free convection when forced convection  the common type that happens in car radiators  works just as well as illustration  choaygame is technically and perfectly correct that only internal energy  not heat  can be advected as a bulk flow of matter containing energy within it and moved from here to there  that means heat pumps don t really pump heat but rather energy  heat cannot because heat cannot be stored in matter since the amount of it there  cannot even be defined  if you can t put a number on it you can t claim it s real temperature and thus kinetic energy may  play only minor roles in this  when energy of phase  trans itions is involved  for example water can be turned to steam and sent down a pipe to  trans fer energy by condensing somewhere else  and yet the temp changes are very small as small as you like for a given  trans fer  they are markets for direction of  trans fer but cannot be used to quantitate how much energy is moved  that s a clue that they aren t fundamental and are in no way the core of what is happening physically  physically it is potential energy being moved  not unlike moving a charged battery from here to there  it actually has nothing to do with heat in a thermodynamic sense ,0

 the tensor density is not artificially introduced the numerical values of the four components of ad are exactly the same as those which appear three times each among the components of aa b c along with three each which are their negatives and forty zeros  so this is merely selecting a subset of components which represent the independent information in the original a  if someone naively attempted to use maxwell s equations in a curvilinear coordinate system or in the presence of significant amounts of gravity  then he would find that they still work in that context  except for the constitutive equations which relate d to e and h to b how can this be explained in your ideology  it only makes sense when one realizes that some of the quantities are tensor densities  so please see that i am not adding tensor densities to make life harder  rather i am finding that they already exist and permitting their use to avoid the extra and unnecessary work of converting everything to ordinary tensors  why multiply by the metric when you do not have to  why use the levi civita connection when partial derivatives will suffice ,0

 notability of buffalo zero a tag has been placed on buffalo zero requesting that it be speedily deleted from wikipedia  this has been done because the article appears to be about a person  group of people  band  club  company  or web content  but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable  that is  why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia  under the criteria for speedy deletion  articles that do not assert the subject s importance or significance may be deleted at any time  please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable  if you think that you can assert the notability of the subject  you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page  just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag coupled with adding a note on the article s talk page explaining your position  but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion  if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay  please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself  but don t hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject s notability under wikipedia guidelines for guidelines on specific types of articles  you may want to check out our criteria for biographies  for web sites  for bands  or for companies  feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this ,0

 removal of patroclus image per new information the image was not removed on the grounds that images that don t contain nudity could be read in an entirely different way  resulting in a different interpretation and only an explicit image would have the obvious homo sex  associations that would necessarily tie it to the topic of the article  we now know that reasoning is incorrect we now know that even images that contain nudity could be read in an entirely different way josiah points out that the exposure of the genitals isn t necessarily a  sex  cue and that there are plenty of red figure images which depict male nudity without being  sex  references and with most greek art of the time nudity is not overtly  sex this new information means that the image no longer meets wikipedia s threshold images that would be considered offensive  profane  or obscene by typical wikipedia readers should be used if and only if their omission would cause the article to be less informative  relevant  or accurate  and no equally suitable alternatives are available thanks for your research  josiah please remove the image  ,0

in response  dear lessheard vanu and to wikipedia including all editors and administrators mr  wales this is a very serious issue we contributing writers have attempted to follow wikipedia written polices in contributing and adding to an existing article or creating one yet there are double standards beings upheld by wikipedia s own editors and administrators as with blackpearl who clearly believes that wikipedias polices don t apply to her  and with other editors who uphold double standards  then when challenged to the double standards  including blackpearl s violation of wikipedia s own written polices and reckless authoritarian rule and control  other wikipedia editors and administrators then support each other when one of them continues to violate wikipedia s own written polices  lessheard vanu had then wrongly and deliberately calls the contributing people who writes back and flags the issue at hand a harassing the editor outright agreeing with blackpearl then in addition to ip address being  block all talk discussion are deleted  leaving only one sided bias and reckless claims against the contributing writers even though wrongly deleted by wikipedia editors administrators  all of this has been recorded  including that blackpearl having repeatedly writing in both correspondence and her bio page  copies have been secure that the articles belong to her and they will continue to be own and controlled by her these statements alone proves that she is in violation of wikipedia s own written polices and purpose yet you have ignored that as previously written in discussion  per wikipedia s own written polices  but immediately deleted by blackpearl and then sanctioned by lessheard vanu blackpearll calls herself evidently mrs  johnny depp and pirate lord ess and such she celebrates on her official wikipedia bio pages that she did many pages and articles on the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean for wikipedia  why would someone devote so much time to check the site and on these pages  and then recklessly calls anyone who doesn t follow her bias views vandals  attackers and such  has her judgement become impaired her goal to fuse her love and fantasies with the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean is very clear that is a conflict of interest and that is not being neutral and is against wikipedia s own written polices sorry  but if one purchases products  such as pirates of the caribbean posters  toys and walt disney merchandise and also using emotional love and fantasies for wikipedia wikinews articles  doesn t make the articles neutral and it causes a conflict of interest  as recorded  blackpearl s pages regarding this issue are one sided  not neutral  are bias  in conflict of interest and are all promotional tools promoting the causes and products of the walt disney company and pirates of the caribbean  yes  pirates of the caribbean and similar wikipedia articles are not neutral  they are a series of one sided promotional pages including links to products and causes of the walt disney company  following wikipedia s own written neutral policy  entire articles would have to be deleted  yet blackpearl continues to violate wikipedia polices and purpose  then with ip s being deliberately  block  and contributing writers having been wrongly accused and falsely called various things  if anyone then attempts to generate a new article related to pirates of the caribbean following wikipedia s own written polices  editors and administrators gang up and generate false reason upon reason  to delete those articles and ban the ip user  they use a countless list of double standards and twisted logic to justify their reckless acts  it s a total lock out by the editors and administrators  abusing their trust tools  acting like a private monarchy  to date  blackpearl s has proven she has ultimate control  has repeatedly stated that is her purpose  and had even sought to have the articles locked  then you lessheard vanu wrote that you don t want to lock these articles  stating it goes against company policy  but yet you added that you are preparing to possibly lock the articles in some capacity and do other acts against those who have been falsely branded and wrongly labeled as vandals and harassing the editors etc other editors and administrators who have proven their practice of bias and manipulative and outright double standards practices include svtcobra and whoville and chris mann we have documented that they say one thing  yet practice another  we have documented that they enforce one set of wikipedia polices yet discard and ignore those same policies when it applies to themselves or their selective circle of peers  we contributing writers also wonder just how many editors and admin,0

 hoover s murder investigation re kennedy the information about hoover s role in the murder investigation of president kennedy is well documented hoover personally directed the investigation into the murder of president john f  kennedy which is often called the crime of the century  the first citation in the kennedy murder section of the article refers to a report by a congressional committee called the house select committee on assassinations  it issued its report in after a three year investigation into the assassination of john kennedy  martin luther king  and robert kennedy  the report by the congressional committee was critical of the performance by the fbi as well as other agencies  the second citation in the section on the kennedy murder is to the pbs frontline news show  it was reviewing the official government records that electrified top washington insiders and have been kept secret for over years  these secret documents were obtained by the assassination records review board many years after they were sealed away from public disclosure  the once secret documents are fascinating  especially as reviewed by pbs  hoover conferred with nicholas katzenbach of the justice department about how to approach an investigation of kennedy s murder  the former attorney general was grilled by the hsca years later on why he was intent on convincing the public that neither a left wing conspiracy or a right wing conspiracy was involved in kennedy s assassination  the copy of his memo is carried by lancer if the reader wants the full version of the testimony by katzenbach the reader should go to the house committee report president johnson  along with hoover  also knew about the oswald impersonator right away  that certainly tends to show a right wing conspiracy with an impersonator pretending to be oswald trying to contact a hit man  maybe there would be another motive for impersonating oswald trying to contact a hit man other than to frame him  i don t know what it would be  there is no question the fbi  under hoover  acted as the primary investigative arm of the warren commission  and hoover testified to the commission as seen from these once secret  trans cripts of the warren commission hearing i have been unable to find any scintilla of evidence showing any foreign conspiracy or any domestic conspiracy that culminated in the assassination of president kennedy the testimony is unsealed now there is no secret anymore about the fbi destruction of evidence  they were caught and its now public knowledge  there is a full pulic record  the agent involved even wrote a book about it  the american public does not believe the conclusions reached by the warren commission and believes the government has something to hide this is what the assassination records review board believes  conclusion  therefore  any editors that think there are other reputable sources that have information please put it in  one should not simply delete well known and documented information just because one doesn t like it  if that were the criteria for deleting information  then wikipedia would be at the mercy of every public relations firm in the country  nothing negative can be written about a public figure because his or her publicist may find it unpleasant and delete it claiming the information is a theory  no  the information is documented by reputable sources what i can t figure out is why mr  hoover s  sex  life gets so much space  and yet someone doesn t want information on hoover s job performance on the biggest case of hoover s career  ,0

 june utc you could take your images with a black background and remove it using photoshop or gimp  you re probably right about oso although it is possible to show  a bit of packing  not necessary though  molecular structures are mostly about the molecule  i respectfully disagree that space filling models are less desirable than ball and stick models  graphite intercalation compound is a prime example  you can see the way the potassium atoms prop open the graphite layers  both styles are complementary although in some cases  one may be much clearer thanks for adding the reference to file rutile unit cell  d balls png  i ve updated the image description  i think it s important to give the source that was actually used for the image  rather than any convenient reference that seems to say the same thing  sometimes there are differences or mistakes in sources that we don t notice until later you make a good point about noting atom colours explicitly  i will start to do that in my image descriptions  it s not always practical  though  to add a caption  chemboxes are a notable example  and often  it is easy to deduce which atom is which colour  e g  phosphorus pentafluoride ,0

 no association between alexander graham bell laboratory and bell labs earlier on this page had enquired name origin wasn t the parent company  and hence weren t the labs  named after alexander graham bell no mention of him can i find here  carrionluggage today user bilcat deleted a recent section addition to the article titled early namesake in its entirety  which chronicled the alexander graham bell laboratory also known as the volta laboratory  which a g  bell created after he won the volta prize the deleted section was titled  early namesake  for the reason that there was an association by name as follows a g  bell receives master phone patent  becomes part owner of the bell telephone company  later renamed american bell telephone company a g  bell creates the volta laboratory  a k a  the alexander graham bell laboratory  for research into sound recording and  trans mission  including the photophone  also the management of american bell created what would become at t  long lines  a g  bell still owns shares in abtc  and hence thus is part owner of at t he remains chief electrician of abtc and its children for several years western union withdrew from the telephone market and allowed bell telephone to acquire its telephone manufacturing arm western electric the long lines project was formally incorporated into a separate company named american telephone and telegraph company  at t the american telephone and telegraph company bought the assets of american bell that would appear to be a friendly takeover of the parent corporation by the child bell labs is created  and assumes the research roles conducted by western electric research laboratories and part of at t  s engineering department whether any research projects were passed from the alexander graham bell laboratory to the western electric research laboratories or at t  engineering  and then onto the newly created bell labs is moot  since the section was entitled early namesake and never inferred that there was such a connection  that there was a connection by name and share ownership  as shown above  is obvious  therefore the deleted section has now been reinstated as pertinent to the bell labs article comments ,0

 every market has its protocols indeed  you could define market as a set of exchange protocols wikipedia cannot handle controversy the emblem at the top of the article this article needs the attention of an expert while seeming to condemn  in a badge of honor wikipedia s regulatory capture by a technologically advanced minority is a good example of dependency theory the lynchpin of economic theory is the idea that people do better when they encounter each other as equals some institutions allow that  some discourage it ,0
yes  you are the very model of flexibility and are the near perfect state of an editor looking for consensus  nobody has tried to compromise except for you and the discussion has dragged on so long because other editors don t understand the brilliance that is your opinion  in seriousness  this entire page is dedicated to other editors diligently trying to work with you but you have little patience for compromise and at the same time accuse you accuse others of bias  i will wait until a compromise version has been produced and then i will weigh in  way too much time has been spent on this page trying to suit a clearly biased point of view ,0

 granted  but that still doesn t make one a criminal  arguing about the law  demonstrating against laws one feels are unjust  advocating changes in the law  and even being an activist in getting laws reconsidered  none of these things are crimes  therefore the simple fact that pedophiles wish the law were different  and may argue that the law  italic should  italic  be different  still does not meet the definition of criminal  the label is inappropriate  your own comment seems to acknowledge this not  having acted as a criminal italics added so let s not try to imply it  ,0

it is too complicated for an encyclopedia  but wikipedia does not follow the norms on scientific topics virtually all of their articles on science are too technical for an encyclopedia  and are essentially of little use to people who are not already studying the topics at an advanced level  an encyclopedia is a reference book that explains things in terms that a non expert can understand  and wikipedia science articles generally fail to serve that function  but that seems to be the accepted practice ,0

well  although i do concede that most  if not all  of those mexican states are named after the cities  i still think that the state should have priority since a  politically and geographically is more important b  they will be linked way more often than the cities  to illustrate my point  let s take the state of oaxaca  we will need a link to the state in every single municipality  oaxaca has in every single river that passes by  in every single lake  lagoon  dam  forest  desert  valley  plateau  mountain  cave  indigenous group  highway  bridge  volcano  beach  port  island  even in biographies  governors  senators  people that fought battles there  colonized keep in mind that most of us do not advocate the application of the north american convention to mexican cities  city  state so whenever we want to be more specific  we make links like xyz  oaxaca not xyz  oaxaca  state by giving priority to the states we could type less and have fewer links to fix in those articles made by visitors  newbies or people not familiar with the country  most wikipedians if someone says that jos vasconcelos was born in oaxaca but links to the state instead of the city  s he is still ok  not as precise as s he intended to be  but s he s still correct  but if someone says that the cave of guil naquitz is in oaxaca and points to the city instead of the state  s he is plain wrong cheers aug utc ,0

 the original use of the word altruism when coined by durkheim implied that here was no reward and that the gains and losses to the individual were in pleasure or some other utility function rather than reproductive success and that the actor was aware of the gains and losses that might accrue however  very often a word is used differently in a specific field than in general usage  e g force in physics vs  forcing yourself to give up smoking in inclusive fitness theory and related disciplines the gains and losses are to reproductive success and the actor and recipeint may or may not be conscious of those gains or losses durkheim s definition is based on intent and the inclusive fitness definition is based on consequences  ,0

 even so  that does not imply that  mexico could not possibly use any generous financial support to buy the arms  ammunition  or other war supplies for the very reason that the u s  was the only sizable arms manufacturer in the americas  to make matters worse  germany could not be counted on to supply mexico with war supplies directly  as the british royal navy controlled the atlantic shipping lanes as the editor has pointed out  mexico could buy weapons produced in argentina  or use the argentinian companies as intermediaries  moreover  as the same editor also pointed out  the of the fuel used by the british royal navy in was produced in mexico  hence  without fuel the british royal navy could not control the atlantic shipping lanes at all  actually  it is not a coincidence that the uk took persia in the partition of the ottoman empire of considering the fact that the anglo persian oil company was founded there in and the uk had learnt the lesson  it is really dangerous to depend exclusively on the oil produced in only one foreign country  well  they learnt the lesson until the oil crisis of finally  let us also recall that the us made plans in for invading mexico and taking control of tampico oil fields  but the us also calculated that mexicans would set in fire the oil fields before they could arrive there  the classical scorched earth technique applied by the russians against napoleon and  hitler usually people does not take into consideration that mexico had a super weapon in the oil fields  because mass production of oil in saudi arabia began until ,0

 september utc  the opening section of the chapter reads during the chavez presidency  rights advocates have faced prosecutorial harassment  unsubstantiated allegations aimed at discrediting their work  and efforts to exclude them from international forums and restrict their access to international funding  it goes on to say  rather than engage constructively with ngos that document abuses and advocate reform to the prison system  the authorities have harassed  intimidated  and marginalized them from policy discussions  in one notable exception the government incorporated civil society experts in a commission set up to analyze and make proposals to reform venezuela s police for the first time the government identified and prioritized accountability for police abuse as a major issue  though it did not ultimately adopt all of the commissions recommendations unfortunately  the commission on police reform is the exception that proves the rule the government most often has sought to discredit and sideline human rights advocates and organizations  context is everything and  if there is any question about whether what i have posted is in context  i urge you to go back and read the entire section  the parts i quoted are from pages of the report ,0

no  i didn t say it didn t exist i just meant to point out that the kind of objectivity you are imposing on our edits and discussions makes little sense when the person we re discussing could quite probably be our old school friend  or our grandmother s neighbour not because we are deliberately exploiting a coi  but because it couldn t be otherwise  even trying to protect the anonymity of research participants is kind of farcical in a small population  in light of our culture  i think your rules about objectivity are antagonistic  assuming you re not some mutant kind of new zealander that is and i wouldn t be surprised if someone makes a bigger deal out of your behaviour ,0
 i agree with the above statements  it is officially republic of kosova  i say it is more than a self declared independent state but an actual independent country  that much must surely be enough to appease the serbian nationalists who are trying to control the look of the page  obviously kosova is as legally a country as they come because as we ve said many times before  the western democracies recognize the state  america would never recognize such rogue states as abkhazia or south ossetia or turkish northern cyrpus or rebel areas of pakistan and afghanistan  the serbs are not in kosova and if they were  it would constitute an occupation  rather like the one they did in the s after milosevic invaded it and joined it to serbia in his greater serbia plan  it is crazy to use the word dispute just to please a minority  limited serbs and some apalling allies ,0

joshbuddy  with due respect  given your manifest ignorance  lack  on this subject then on what basis am i to accept your opinion of the verified lead in language rather than my own opinion that the verified lead in language is fine  for goodness sake  your previous edit asserted gross error on an extremely important subject  one where continued health and or life have hung in the balance more than a few times  as for the rest of the article  i do plan on addressing some pure opinion therein  and to add verification where it is needed along the way  despite this future work  and contrary to your opinion  the current introduction does provide sufficient summarization for an encyclopaedic entry  before you tinker anymore with this subject i recommend you read a wide range of peer reviewed literature on the same subject  you ll find the current  verified  introductory language to be consistent  that you have not applied yourself to this endeavour already is manifest  so i am not making any assumptions on this point  this is a very serious subject deserving of a very high standard of presentation and substantiation ,0

reply to herd of swine  thank you for clarifying your note and that you do not intend to discount my contributions as it happens  i did not come across this article randomly  i found it by following a link in an article about a bacteria used to  trans fer dna for genetic engineering of plants  reply in general in regards to including the links it appears that the question has already been discussed in detail  and that each side of the debate are pretty much decided in their positions i doubt that anything i could write would change anyone s mind  and probably most of the information has already been dug up already  it appears to be just a question of waiting for more people to come along and offer their opinions about it to break the tie  the posts by levine seem to me to adequately cover the way i understand the situation  in particular his or her  summary at time stamp so in determining consensus at w hate ver point in this process that happens  my recommendation is that both external links be removed ,0

 ok  the convention on naming appears to be falling by the wayside  some cities articles  ie  toronto  montreal  are titled as the city s name only while others  chicago  winnipeg  calgary  vancouver  are burdened with having the state or province following the city in the article title  in response to your omment below the full name of toronto is toronto  ontario  canada which is unnecessarily long as an article name  besides  wikipedia articles use the most common name  not the full name of article subjects  e g united states  not united states of america and united kingdom  not united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland wikipedia is an international encyclopedia  not a north american one  so the article title should be what readers around the world will think of first  not just those in north america  many people outside of canada have not heard of ontario  even though they know about toronto  let s just leave keep it simple  and keep the existing redirect from toronto  ontario to toronto ground zero t  and seeing that you are administrator please re name the winnipeg  manitoba  calgary  alberta  edmonton  alberta  and vancouver  british columbia articles to winnipeg calgary edmonton and vancouver respectively their full names ie  winnipeg  manitoba  canada  are unnecessarily long and readers worldwide know of these cities even if they have not heard of manitoba  alberta  or british columbia  as you suggest  let s keep it simple  we should not imply that toronto  montreal  and ottawa  by the way  both vancouver and calgary are larger than ottawa  are in a different league  so let s say that all canadian cities of over should stand on their own  we ll make up our own rules as we go along  thanks  i hope you are able to do this soon  ,0

 you bet  i indeed am frustrated disappointed or should i disheartened and disgusted  not because of the block though  it s because of the spiteful hate ful and downright vindictive behaviour some people have in wikipedia and with profound connivance of some administrators even  mihaiam is a sock of edward just look at their contributions for past hours  why should i be involved be anymore editing  although i really want to  when i know that some daft  hate r may simply revert all of them without caring much about silly things like justification or consequence and i will be  block  as a result  i shouldn t be involved  wikipedia  like any other bureaucracy  is ruled by bullies  including some administrators however  the real bureaucracies do give you a chance to settle the dispute in court or police station  and at least you can afford to not be so helpless about it  here my edits were labelled as propaganda  implying that i m a propagandist  after all my edits were rashly reverted  although they had the chance to simply modify inaccuracies with good sources  they chose to delete the whole section nothing was done and because nothing was done  the reversion of my edits only accelerated  now  if not all  most of my edits are entirely reverted then that genius john wrote on my talk page  i m edit warring  i usually specifically mention  no edit war intended  after my edit  in description  my friggin edits are getting reverted and i m the one he deemed to be the edit warrior  come on now  will you  you don t want to help me  frankly  i don t know what you want  have a beautiful time here at the wikipedia  humanity is withering away much faster here at the wikipedia than in the real world  the real world is sick in my view  but  in comparison to the demented arrangement here at wikipediabecause here it every time sometimes  gratuitously comes down to majority of consensus  no matter how ignorant and or prejudiced and or oblivious the involved editors are about the topic at hand  their views still count  that s not a very efficient way  that is rather a crazy medieval way of discerning what s reliable and what s not  and thus  implies that minority is always wrong and majority is always correct  that s fundamentally incorrect real world seems like a much better place to dwellalthough i concede that some  few  of my sources too were questionable and faced justified skepticism  i don t think that it necessitated a whole reversion  slight modifications would have worked just fine thank god science doesn t progress like that in real world  talk note ,0

 i would simply do away with that list  if you are to ask me  however  if it is to stay  i have to say no  because those people are romanian citizens from the moment romania existed  just wait until it gets to point out its paradoxes  and then perhaps i ll be supported in removing it you missed the point  this does not group people by by ethnicity or citizenship  but by where they were born  that region is now in romania  and  as i have pointed out  wikipedia disregards past sovereignties not for the sake of jingoism  but for the sake of simplicity and logic  you could only accuse me of something if i were to go and remove people listed here from their hungarian something categories  or their mention on list of hungarians ,0

i have edited this article as i thought it was expressing to strongly th political views of a few people who are seeking to promote areas of england as celtic nations  i have left references in for this but toned them down to a realistic level  the article sould be about  modern celts  whereas orginally it was more an article about this viewpoint which is a tiny proportion of the  modern celts  subject and a recent devolpement i also thought this not as siginificant as the continous argument regarding galicia  which it overshadowed  perhaps instead a realistic  celtic remains in england  page would be more appropiate  bg,0

 october utc as i said above  deep learning is the name of a class of algorithms  feedforward neural nets  restricted boltzmann machines  deep neural networks and deep belief networks are all mathematical models  how the models are trained  that is  how model parameters are chosen to optimize some loss function  is another topic entirely  people had looked at deep neural network architectures before deep learning techniques were developed  but it was the deep learning techniquesunsupervised pre training  layer by layerthat made deep networks more practical at the time  with today s gpu based algorithms  the need for pre training has lessened  the hype surrounding deep learning has muddied the concept to point that people like michael jordan claim it is just a synonym for neural network  but the backlash from current hype doesn t change the historical importance of deep learning algorithms in generating interest and good results in deep neural network models or representational learning  schmidhuber s review has a good discussion of these issues ,0

oops i was just about to post this before you posted yours i might as well anyways furthermore  as far as internal textual evidence goes  there are certain things which clearly show that this could not be the work of ptolemy for example  several of the aphorisms make explicit references to horary astrology  which is not something that ptolemy addressed at all in the tetrabiblos one of the reasons for this  among others  is that interrogational astrology  ie  horary  was not developed until the  nd and  rd centuries and this development occurred in india within the hindu tradition see pingree pg horary was not a part of the mainstream tradition of hellenistic astrology from which ptolemy and his contemporaries were drawing on  and it did not become integrated into the western tradition of horoscopic astrology until the middle ages when the various arab and persian astrologers undertook a synthesis of the indian  persian and hellenistic traditions so you see  even the internal evidence in the text itself with the references to horary show that this could not have been the work of claudius ptolemy ,0

 well  since tony  the tiger i mean marine seems to be waffling and going back on his report of nyc being confirmed to him  a friend  or maybe his mother  who really knows  he seems to be self serving and desirious of changing the facts  rules  policies  et al in order to gain favor from future voters for gov of pr  when he runs he certainly has shown his true colors and how he ever became an administrator surely puts wiki at the forefront of the pandering and self serving purposes displayed here  i think i know a way that those who support puerta rico as his pob  tony should ask his friend the cop no doubt another greasy spic  in florida to write an internet article about baez and include in it a reference to the tmz  and other bogus unreliable references  and the report that baez  office personnel lied and that baez was indeed born in puerta rico  while this would be a fabrication  and in effect a lie  we all know that cops are professional overpaid liars to begin with  so this wouldn t be a problem for his greasy cop spic friend  then they would have the support of a confirmed  verifiable and believable source to cite in place of the nationally televised television interview by bw  subsequently  the puerta rican loving dirtbags can invalidate any consensus and ignore everyone that is in search of the truth  this entry has been archived and we shall see  if this page remains or it disappears from view  have a nice day ,0

 august utc w hate ver the flight should be called depends on what criteria are used if one goes by what the tickets read and what the gate agents and flight attendants announced  the flight is delta flight or if you want to be real technical  something very similar to delta flight operated by comair for delta connection  however  if one goes by how the pilots and air traffic controllers referred to the flight  then it is comair flight their actual words would have been comair thus far the news media has called it comair flight probably for two reasons one  the flight was called everywhere that wasn t behind the scenes and two  delta wants to make it clear that the flight wasn t operated by delta  but was instead operated by comair therefore one winds up with comair flight which works  but isn t really quite accurate alex ,0

  it was originally both located  what we might call an institutional home and indeed published at harvard university  or at least in cambridge home and publishing location are not always the same for example  mind s home is the university of york  but it s published at oxford i do not believe the editor has to be located at the home  especially not anymore with email and cloud storage and all that fancy stuff i think the reason it helps to mention that it was originally at harvard is because both the old issues list the location as harvard and citations may list harvard  so keeping a record of that here helps anyone trying to understand that the old issues are indeed part of this journal  also  it could be recorded just for the record it is part of the history of the journal after all  discussion contributions ,0

actually improving the references in those sections to make them inline was something i already planned on doing at some point  hopefully with more diverse sources  definitely fair to say that the majority of the content currently in those country sections  barring brazil and mexico  came from a single source  whether it was the compliance report or the country specific abduction flyer it was the us dos  though it is a particularly reliable source is is also not without its own bias in most of the sections i just copy pasted everything from both items  various reports and flyer if it existed  and then copyedited the content for readability  prose and to remove summarize duplicate info  many yearly reports duplicated content from other years  so i wouldn t be surprised if a sentence or two got left in verbatim that came from a state dept  document ,0

 aha  so  it is not about bessarabia  it is about soviet demands over bessarabia  i think this is the core issue of numerous misunderstandings  if we start from analyzing what the soviets demanded and see that romania and the west did not made sufficient steps to apease it  we observe insuficient action from the side of romania  did not organize a referendum as well as from the west  did not succeed in overthrowing the reds to try is not enough but also we run into which obviously ties the hands of romania  w hate ver you say  it was much more important for romania to have normal relations with the rest of the world than with russia but i said from early on  that bessarabia  not russia is the center of the issue  it is bessarabians that chose this or that  not romania or russia  russia had intervened only in without being invited by a local body or by mps from bessarabia  without even a mock support from inside bessarabia  why should russia s demand be treated supperior to bessarabia s choice  good or bad  it was a choice made in full awareness the  military  treaty you mention was signed in february  i e  before march between two neighboring to bessarabia countries  it can not possibly tie the hands of bessarabia itself  by then an independent country about autonomy  as far as i know  after the november  resp december union of bukovina  resp trans ylvania  a government was set for the entire united romania  led by a  trans ylvanian politician  alexandru vaida voevod he was too liberal for the phanariot minded politicians that used to govern in bucharest before  they tolerated new romanians in government only becuse the circumstances made that necessary  among other things  vaida started a large campain of land reform  widely supported also by bukovinians and bessarabians  but very feared by the old ruling elite in bucharest  recall the peasant uprising  still very fresh in mind they tollerated vaida s governments  there were or i think  for ca year  and in early a black coalition was formed  and general averescu became prime minister  similar to the one formed in romania in early against basescu  which lamenably failed within month  but dragged the country more into politicianist discourse until last autumn land reform was limited and only went as far as to finish what was started  the new constitution of was written by these people  who put the word unitary everywhere they could fit it into  thus the autonomy of all three new provinces was not enshrined in the new constitution  in return that led to a bitter division of the politics  on one side national liberal party of bucharest old politicians  on the other the  trans ylvanian dominated national  r  nist party  in the latter started to gain momentum  and to sealed it they brought in carol ii from forced exile  but carol ii turned to be even worse  so they actually shut themselves into leg  so to say  that led some of them to more nationalistic discurse  for example vaida himself dahn even calls him fascist  which is not true  but i don t want to argue with dahn others managed to escape this trap  for example maniu you see  you have to take into consideration the entire going ons  bessarabia was left without regional autonomy because no other province got it  which in turn was because the old phanariot mineded people carried the day in early s  these people lost the grip on power  but it took time  even in modern romania you still have the continuation of the same disputes  on one side you have many politicians asking for setting up regions and more local autonomy  again  surprisingly many  trans ylvanians among them on the other side you have the command system minded partly communist foprmed bureaucracy  who fear regionalization  again  surprizingly many oltenians and other likes of them among but unlike the interbelic period  it seem that now the movement is strictly oriented in one direction  regionalization and greater local autonomy is inevitable  whether you bring the eu standard pretext or not  so  my second part of the answer is  if it were not for the soviet occupation  the rise of fascism  and wwii  we would have had autonomy for bessarabia  with a powerful local legislative body  by s  communism only created a pause  things continue to roll today talk  ,0

a few major concerns with this article the opening paragraph says unequivocally that newton discovered calculus in this early notes years before leibniz  however  this is not a solid historical fact in my opinion  this is based on the reports of newton s own inner circle who claimed that newton showed the calculus to them  these very men had obviously taken newton s side in a bitter debate that had seen newton actively try to obfuscate the issue  newton even anonymously wrote the concluding remarks in the report by his own royal society whihc claimed leibniz a fraud and newton the true discoverer  it should be added to the opening paragraph that the dates of newton s first use of the calculus are based on the witness accounts of newton s close confidants ,0

 okay  i understand that the encyclopedia needs to describe things in a way that reflects the industry standards  so i m not disputing this wiki s use of which connector type is male vs  female  but i am  however  still just curious about it  these are my questions with other cables i ve seen  the male end is the one where there is a center pin or set of pins plugging into a jack where there s a receiving hole in the center  whether or not there s also a female like sheathe of some kind around the connector pins  for examples  coaxial cables  f  rca  etc din cables  s video  some older rounded computer cable plugs  etc d plugs  and dvi  of course there would be others  too  okay  so the one with the pins has been male  while the one that the pins plug into is female  even if the one with the holes fits into an outer casing that the one with the pins is in well  that s been true up until hdmi came out  apparently  look at hdmi and what the industry is calling its female and male ends  they re calling the end with the pin row the female end  and the end with the slot that the row of pins plugs into the male end  and keep in mind that the end with the bar of pins is also the end with a female like casing around it  just as i pointed out above  yet those above like that are still male  yes  the slotted end of hdmi sort of plugs into the sheathed like end  but then so do several of those others i mentioned above which were always called female  because what really counts has been the pins  not the edges  so why isn t hdmi s pin end the one called male like the others who is it in the industry that first insisted that this slotted end of hdmi should be called backwards of other kinds of plugs  the male end  and that the end with the pins in the middle should be called backwards of other connectors  the female end  who from the industry started that and sort of dictated to encyclopedias  etc  that this is how it s supposed to be  and what made them the supposed authority thanks  mike member maxx fordham ,0
clarify he s navy i think it would be useful to clarify for the article that he s a member of the navy  since the vast majority of people seem to think he s in the marines i know for a fact that it is mentioned a few times that the spartans are under the jurisdiction of the office of naval intelligence  but does anyone have quotes from either the game or the books to directly back it up  i can t remember exactly were i first head the oni being in charge ,0

 thank you i ve posted an associated press article that appeared on the news wires today  on the discussion page for nitrites the article validates my concerns about wikipedia  i imagine you ll edit it out  or delete it i suspect that the general public  gets it  about wikipedia  too it s regrettable that the folks who are the most knowledgeable about  and best able to use  the intracacies of wikipedia s rules and regulations are also the people best equipted to use that knowlege to stifle newbies  and or those who are less computer savvy  who may make mistakes  or who haven t even yet heard about what a  sock puppet  is  or rr rule  or w hate ver rules you and heah used to stifle my contributons i doubt you ll  get it nor do i care but  at the end of the day  just maybe there s a chance that you ll actually understand the damage you do by your holier than thou attitudes  and arrogant computer geek power plays this is in no way meant to be a personal attack on you or heah  or anyone else who edits in wikipedia  it s simply the reaction of an ordinary guy  based on his observations and experiences after being stifled by those who dissagreed with his edits  you and heah  in addition to not agreeing with my edits  clearly have the superiour knowledge of how wikipedia works  which made it easy for you to throw  down obstables to my postings  make false allegations of wrong doing  and activate wikipedia s rules to either threaten to ban me or block me  or  as you did  to actually ban or block me  but the more important issue  and problem  is for wikipedia itself  namely  that this kind of censorship is akin to the autoritarion rulers whose people are only allowed to see or read w hate ver the rulers deem suitable  which will  as i ve said before  only serve to further diminish the already tarnished reputaton of wikipedia  ,0

 thank you for the renames  is there any way a non admin user like me can help with the backlog would that there were  not for that particular backlog  however  there s lots of other places to help  take a look at this  scary aint it yikes  instead everyone s over at ani bickering  they should come back to the party  that s why we re here  a lot of necessary things happen through ani but yeah  there s a ton of unnecessary drama and bickering in the mix that is a hug time drain  not one of my favorite places to visit  deletion of robert a foster hello you have deleted a page for robert a foster  please could you put it back on or can i make a new one  he is in the new bbc  just william  and is a up and coming actor many thanks nov gmt  hi  the entire contents of the page you  i assume  created and i deleted was hang on the prior contents of the page  deleted by a different administrator  was just william tv serial so the page was basically a blank slate with no tailored text at all upon both creations  if this actor is notable  see also wikipedia notability  people  entertainers  then i suggest you create the page as a subpage of your user or user talk page so that you have time to work on it before going live by placing it in the main part of the encyclopedia  and so it doesn t get deleted again as having no substantive content  there is an article wizard which can walk you through the steps  you say he is an up and coming actor well i don t know if there are sufficient sources to support an encyclopedia article  but this statement makes me wary  please see wikipedia up and coming next big thing  note that if the page is an appropriate topic for an article  it would take normal english name punctuation  which means the middle initial would take a period  i e robert a  foster  deletion of international association of physics students hello  you deleted the article for the international association of physics students based on copyright infringement from the webpage iaps info  it did seem that way  as the article was mostly copied from iaps info  but it was done by the executive committee of iaps  so we would like to ask you to reinstate the article  if it is needed we can put a statement on the homepage allowing wikipedia to copy written content from our page or something like that  thanks  preceding unsigned comment added by talk contribs hi p o e  i have taken the liberty of adding a section header to your post and adding your signature  on talk pages  but not in articles you should sign your posts so that people can follow who wrote what regarding the above page  there s a few matters you should understand  we cannot use copyrighted text simply because we have been given permission  instead all of our text must be freely licensed so that our end users can take the material and use it themselves under our licenses  please see wikipedia donating copyrighted materials  the upshot is that for us to use the material which means allowing our readers to use it and modify it even for commercial purposes we have to have a verified release of the material  to do that  you can follow either of the methods listed at the page  specifically  please look at the subsection of the page entitled granting us permission to copy material already online if you do that  it will take care of a first hurdle but i don t think you should bother because the text itself is not appropriate for an article it its current form  this is an encyclopedia  can you imagine a proper encyclopedia articles saying things like we support our members  what you should do is start from scratch and try to write a proper encyclopedia article that cites to reliable third party sources and contains neutral language  user tal,0

 the punk rock page has more meat in the text and its a lot of text content then a photo so the glance is in favor of the text i do see some areas that can be fleshed out i think the hardcore page wouldn t work with every section in depth like theirs  thats what makes this page also unique to hardcore but i do think that some sections here are too small and that would work to balance out the photos to keep the text the main teaching and learning tool i would like to resize the photo of zines a little smaller even if it has to be re uploaded then it might now be too much and too busy people read to retain information the right set up enhances that too many pictures are a distraction they take away from the knowledge more fleshed out sections can help ill brainstorm on that until later i guess add the picture  if it bumps the others too far out of whack we can resize it or when the story gets fleshed out a little  maybe it will balance itself out more  the third option is we can fill out some sections more make it more balanced and then add the zines  photo  after  so it accentuates and isn t the meat and potatoes of the section the sections of influence on other genres that could be good place to start adding more content depth ill study some other pages meanwhile when i get a chance then bring that knowledge here a little later thanks a lot i love to share knowledge and i like sharing that here for free ,0

response to your post about iryani your silly post on my talk page demonstrates exactly the pov pushing that is mocking the integrity of the article  forcibly abducted is absolutely ridiculous especially when the parents had died and he was adopted to be taken care of  i don t even think the original article even had those terms and if it did  it would be pov  you want to post paragraphs of a story  much of it plagiarized  that is attributed to abdul rahman by some person who learned from some other person who claims to be the grandson of the sister of a man that the sister has not seen for decades and who lives in a country they have no access to absolutely ludicrous  the haaretz s source  mizrahi  isn t exactly an authority source on abdul rahman s life  family sources in yemen are more credible  but the best source is an autobiography or written biography by someone who knew him  if you want to write paragraphs on his life story  then it should be from a credible  reliable  verified story  if you want to write paragraphs on an unverified  faulty allegation  believed to be refuted with a reasonable argument supported by evidence then you can guarantee that i will keep reverting you until you realize exactly what kind of mockery you are trying to force happen here  i am treating the allegation as an allegation and you are treating the allegation as if it is his true life story  your motives are not of good faith ,0

 sorry  i m not sure i follow your argument  i understand that there are many people going by the name of andrew robertson but my basis for this proposal is that anyone searching for andy andrew robertson will almost certainly be looking for this person  wp ptopic indeed  anyone saying andrew robertson in a glasgow pub will almost certainly be referring to him  the coverage of his rise from amateur to international football in less than a year has consistently been covered in the scottish press  he s one of the most talked about players in scotland at the moment and is expected to be the first choice left back for the national team for several years  most of the other andrew robertson articles on wikipedia are stubs and a quick google  shows that he is clearly covered more than any other andrew robertson  ,0

 wikimedia blog post hello  everyone trying to be as polite and good faithy as possible here this morning i hope i won t be smited for pointing something out again the current wikimedia foundation blog post is wikipedia for schools project the blog talks about how wikipedia for schools was born out of sos children it s a great project  providing underprivileged kids in the third world with curated  age appropriate content from wikipedia but when you go to see who wrote the wikipedia articles about the organization and the program  one can see the all too familiar pattern of editorial dominance by conflict of interest accounts two days ago  a big chunk of content was added to sos children s villages uk by user rwilcox rainbow wilcox happens to be website content editor at sos children no disclosure by rwilcox so if that is indeed ms  wilcox  the edits are in violation of the wikimedia foundation s terms of use of this site similarly  on monday  the day the new terms of use went into effect user rory soschildren was working on the article rory hughes social media marketer for sos children in a bit of contrast  user jamieg identifies himself on his talk page as follows  i work for an international children s charity called sos children so we can assume this is jamie goodland who received special thanks in the wmf blog post likewise  user duncanharris identifies on his user page  i am entirely responsible for the technical work on the schools wikipedia selection  this work was funded by sos children uk  part of the world s largest orphan charity and user bozmo identifies  as andrew cates  on his user page with  i also worked from part time as ceo  for the charity sos children  might i make a recommendation now that the new terms of use is coming up on its first week of implementation  maybe someone from the wikimedia blog staff could make it a point  that whenever they are featuring a person or an organization that has a relevant wikipedia article  that part of the blogger s responsibility is to reach out to any potentially conflicted editors representing the blog subject  to ask them to self identify per the new terms of use  so that the wikimedia blog is not inadvertently showcasing violators of the terms of use of the foundation s project to do my part  i will be happy to reach out now to users rwilcox and rory soschildren  to let them know of this conversation  so  it would be nice if it isn t deleted or hatted ,0

  hi  it was me who wrote that caption  however i did not say originally  my sentence is the iqs of a large enough population are calculated so that they conform to a normal distribution  i totally agree with you that this is not how it was done originally  but as far as i know  this is how it is done today  unfortunately  i don t have a specific source for it  but it is basically what i have understood from reading lots of intelligence test manuals  books on assessment and intelligence  etc there is no research that says that amount of intelligence is distributed across the population in the same way as a normal distribution  but this is the way iq tests are made  for example  if a small country suddenly gets a high influx of highly intelligent immigrants  suddenly more than of the population would have an iq of or higher  but instead of changing the normal distribution  the next time when they standardize the iq test  they take a representative sample of or inhabitants  and the ones that have an average intelligence get iq the most intelligent people get iq or more  the least intelligent people get iq or less  this is how i have understood the statistics behind iq  however  i am not a statistics specialist at all  so please correct me if i am wrong talk  ,0

 statements like  are flagrantly inaccurate  please check my edits honestly before getting swayed by the lies of this user  this user has been stalking me and reverting all my comparatively larger edits without providing enough reason  one example  just because one of my sentences contained one slightest  but i m not too sure if it was incorrect at all  scientific inaccuracy he rashly reverted the whole edit when he could have enriched the article by simply correcting the inaccuracy with good sources i sincerely think he is starting multiple edit wars at once  he thinks just because i don t have many administrator friends he could revert my changes  his primary claim is that none of my sources are reliable but his her sources are  just look at his contributions  his contributions are mostly deletions of the edits he doesn t like  also his activity is mysteriously sporadic  he might as well be a sock  he also claims that whoever supports my position is my sockpuppet i m really discouraged by this sort of behaviour  please someone help me  talk ,0

 concentrate  it is prohibited to work as a guide when you have no licence  this rule holds almost everywhere in the world  this has become quite a big problem even for slovak persons in bratislava  i know that from direct personal experience  they were very strict with this  the local policeman  or ward or whoever  thought that this rule was broken in that particular case and therefore the non guide was interrogated  that is all  an absolutely normal situation  the fact that the non guide was a hungarian is a coincidence  after all they are not the only hungarian tourists in slovakia this is not the first case of such interrogations  and the fact that the policeman was probably wrong is also nothing special  although this is not sure  as far as i remember the only problem of this case has been the reaction of hungarian media  ,0

 the treatment options for prostate cancer depend in part on your age  your overall health and whether the tumor has spread  for tumors that are still inside the prostate  radiation therapy  using x rays that kill the cancer cells  and a surgery called radical prostatectomy are common treatment options  watchful waiting is also a treatment option  in this approach  no treatment is given until the tumor gets bigger  watchful waiting may be the best choice for an older man who has a higher risk of dying from something other than his prostate cancer usually  tumors that have grown beyond the edge of the prostate can t be cured with either radiation or surgery  they can be treated with hormones that slow the cancer s growth  ,0

paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized however  the term fossilized is not a very precise term there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate  invertebrates  radiolarians  sponges  plants  pollen  foot prints  etc and multiple processes may include permineralization  recrystalization  carbonization  replacement  dissolving  diagenesis  etc talking about fossilization is a complex issue  however quick burial is not questioned the major question is  how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab  which of course implies that given the right conditions  vast ages are not an issue the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood  but rather that there has been some years for the processes to have been working much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains yet  how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with ,0

 utc i agree with user man with two legs that the graph is extremely misleading see this quote about  or maybe from edward tufte before the development of spreadsheet graphing  the most common graphical mistake was the use of artist drawn d images with the height of d objects representing the magnitude of the data points in these charts  both the height and the width of the drawn object increase proportionate to the magnitude of the data points the effect is to exaggerate the differences in magnitude as the viewer tends to perceive the area of the figures rather than just the height as representing the magnitude source the image suggests that the tsar bomba  which was three or four times more powerful than castle bravo  is actually times larger in volume  or x larger in area if explosion volume went up by about the cube of the yield  not really accurate  but much closer than this chart  the tsar bomba mushroom cloud would be x taller than castle bravo and x taller than hiroshima instead  the diagram shows the cb and tb over a thousand times taller  on this scale  one could conclude that since the hiroshima bombing s mushroom cloud was about four miles high  the tsar bomba explosion x taller  must be larger than the earth itself july ,0

 h here is a clarification  the original semitic people came from arabia  they moved north and east  after time  the semitic people devised many dialects of semitic those dialects became known as languages after diversification  ishmael with his mother moved to the arabic concentrated area  ishmael learned arabic and married an arab girl  he begot arab children from their mothers side  those children again married arab  this continued until those children became a big tribe called quraysh or quraish  reknowed for the perfection of their dialect of arabic for being a strong and honored tribe among the arabs  their dna would have been diluted nearly completely by the arab tribe ishmael joined  but as we know the y chromasome is passed down by the father  hence it is relavent to state that quraysh s male population would have had a great affinity geneticly to ishmael  the non arab  yet maternaly they would have had a greater affinity to the other arab tribes  by bb ,0

 well it looks like you others who have an account added the rat factoid  what with it explaining the ending scorpion  as to your last edit of dominik about changing  the line  to the rat  what was meant was that the last line of this episode referes to the symbolisism of the rat in the last scene of the film  i can t edit anything so hopefully you folks can solve this yourself and dominik  per your own hypothetical scenario  if in fifty years from now someone does watch the episode  wouldn t they be confused as to the last moment it s not a question of explaining a joke  it s a question of elucidating an unclear ending the former can be superfluous  the latter is necessary finally  and this is towards ctjf and momusufan  i freely admit that i am no expert about the bureaucratic nature of and rules of this site but i m guessing double standards  wrongful accusations and automatic mistrust goes against the spirit and the letter of the rules here this is why i asked an administrator to look at the situation in regards to the rules and whether i or you overstepped any of them and any suggestions of way to rectify this matter  and was not  as you falsely imply  to give an opinion about the inclusion of the line itself this is all moot since this fact is now in the article despite your vociferous attempts to block it in all likelyhood  were i a registered user  this would have never been an issue and my edit would have remained it s quite a hypocritical paradox that anonymous users who are more ignorant of the requirements in editing an article are held to a higher standard than those users familiar with them but then i m guessing that in the encyclopedia anyone can edit which represents the sum of human knowledge it is not acceptable and you two for w hate ver personal reasons  chose to ignore those very concepts that you clame to profess and want others to follow ,0

 you are saying i was much more vicious but offer no indication as to what qualifies as much more that is as arbitrary an assessment as the decision to block me and not mmx i have come to expect that from this site however as it seems mostly in the spirit of censorship then discourse  even you instead of offering positive instruction  you make your first order of business to threaten me with what you would have done had you my balls in your vice instead of other admin and the other tidbit to cool off thanks  you guys are like the middle school hall monitor that gets a little power and feels the need to just flex it without conversation  discourse or investigation  the three users arthur rubin  mmx and rootology together effectively ganged up and reverted the article well over times in regards to my contributions but not only do you ignore their actions  but you find me in contempt for what they were doing  the problem is  i did not simply revert  i actually edited the article each time  i also did not revert in a consecutive series of edits  but in response to different reverts  i maintained discussion  and replied in the edit summary as to why and what i was editing before i saved my changes but you just ignore all of that  slap mmx on the wrist  what was it  you reminded him he was bad  i could have been reminded too  but upon reflection  the threat you prefaced this lates response with was more effective  i feel better about wiki and its members now regardless  i will just start making minor absurd edits for future reverts before saving changes ,0

and  to ret  prof seeing how others have pointed out at wp ftn regarding the gospel of matthew that you seem to have used quotes from various sources as support of beliefs theories that are actually opposed by them  i think that it probably is a very good idea for you to at least take a break  and also read all the guidelines  including those which deal with the correct and incorrect use of sources  as you seem to have done there  really  i cannot see any excuse for such conduct  and it is very  very hard to believe that such apparently willful misuse of sources to support beliefs that they do not in fact support is something you shouldn t already very clearly know should not be done  there honestly is no acceptable reason for doing so ,0

new orleans during this period  oswald began to consider returning to the soviet union or going to cuba  there is a no source cited here because it is impossible to know oswald s considerations  we can hypothesize but it is better to present the facts and let the reader do their own thinking  the statement is not fair because it grasps at the bounds of the imagination by assuming that the mexico trip took place  since that entire incident was even questioned by the warren commission s own investigator  into the incident  wesley liebeler  the alleged mexico trip cannot be used as basis for the conclusion that oswald wanted to move to russia or cuba the  pamphlet  trial got news media attention there was no trial  oswald pled guilty to disturbing the peace and paid a fine warren report vol  xxv p exhibit the arrest go media attention  notably absent from the wikipedia paragraph is his strange relationship with fbi agent john lester quigley  the first person to visit oswald in jail jim garrison in his unsuccessful attempt to link oswald to wealthy local businessman clay shaw  his attempt was very successful  hsca noted the credibility of garrison s link from shaw to oswald  it called the clinton witnesses whom saw the two together  the committee found that the clinton witnesses were credible and significant  hsca report page concerning oswald and david ferrie  however  there is no credible evidence they had any significant contact when oswald was a teenager  the source cited is footnote hsca vol  ix p while it would be correct to quote hsca s conclusion it is an outright lie to state this as a fact  in addition to the photo of ferrie and oswald together the warren commission took the testimony of oswald s high school classmates fredrick o sullivan  wc vol  vi p and edward vobel  wc vol  vi p whom both testified to year old oswald and ferrie meeting  why would the warren commission be asking specifically about ferrie if there was no credible evidence there is also no mention of ferrie s motive for being with the teenage cap  he would attempt to recruit teenage boys to molest  both pro and anti conspiracy researchers including the warren commission have questioned oswald s  sex ity due to his association with  gay  men in new orleans the clinton witnesses  contained numerous contradictions to their testimony at the clay shaw trial in and to their testimony to the committee in wikipedia editors hypocritically claim there is not enough space to include all facts and theories yet there is plenty of space to attack the clinton la witnesses again and again and again and again and again  worse yet this statement is not in quotations as a conclusion of gerald posner as cited in footnote it is written in the article as an objective fact  if you are going to use statements from posner then put them in quotations as his conclusions not facts  return to dallas oswald was last seen by a co worker alone on the sixth floor of the depository about minutes before the assassination  another outright lie  footnote has cited the warren commission testimony of charles givens  the last witness to affirmatively see oswald before the assassination was carolyn arnold in the lunch room at wc vol  xxii p she was also interviewed by reporter anthony summers in conspiracy page this lie speaks volumes as to wikipedia s intentions  they would rather mention a less significant witness simply to get in the statement of a brown bag  in crossfire jim marrs attempts to present an even more detailed hypothesis for oswald s movements before the assassination but much of this is based on loose interpretations of witness statements it is very significant that oswald was the only employee whom did not eat their lunch outside or by a window in anticipation of the motorcade  instead he stuck deep inside the depository in the  nd floor lunchroom by the only accessible phone  the same room he was found in only seconds after the assassination by roy truly and ml baker  in the day kennedy was shot jim bishop claimed oswald salivated for minutes by the sixth floor window awaiting the motorcade  this is obviously contradicted by both carolyn arnold and bonnie ray williams whom ate his lunch by the assassination window until or before joining his friends on the  th floor  his chicken bones were later found by police cwc ,0
 in comedy deleted the in comedy section  it adds nothing to an understanding of jack ruby  and distracts from the rest of the article  any significant influence by ruby upon comedy could be placed in the popular culture section  any ruby related jokes are gratuitous at best  in the popular culture section  nofx reference i don t think the reference to the nofx song the man i killed being about jack ruby is correct  from what i ve read  and my interpretation of the song  it is about someone  perhaps fat mike the lead singer  killing a world leader  most likely george w  bush unless a good reference can be found to support the claim i don t think it is appropriate to have this claim listed under the popular culture section  i am going to remove it for the time being  nixon ruby connection a number of sources claim that there was some sort of connection between jack ruby and richard nixon even if this is all conspiracy nonsense  it should be somehow addressed in this article so people looking for information on the connection can get the truth and won t continue on to some other less reliable source learn to spell  i ve seen a physical piece of paper  which of course i couldn t yet scan  at the national archives in the s my father was a good friend of e  raymond lewis  librarian of the house of representative iirc  and i would hang out talking to whomever while they met rubenstein had been subpeonaed by mccarthy s subcommitee on investigations  nixon sent a note  which is what i saw  saying that ruby had been working for him in a confidential capacity and it would be unacceptable to question him in public  i forget the exact wording the subpoena was revoked  i think the paper might have been in the congressional record see wp nor  crank  i ve got a xerox copy of that document  and it has a zip code on the fbi letterhead that s a bit of a problem  since there were no zip codes when it was supposedly was written it s actually widely admitted to be a forgery john mcadams a case has been made for explaining the zip code  that the one page xerox is really a composite of different documents  the top  on fbi letterhead  is a half page undated typed note note  extra copy  inclosure not verified by official report  return to file  this is sensitive used as a  trans mittal sheet  stapled on top of full page underneath  only the bottom half of the full sheet dated is seen if this is correct  the presence of the zip code on the letterhead need not affect the dating of the bottom half  see discussion here  first let me say i don t know how to add new sections on wiki or wiki talk pages so i m putting this here even though it s not related to nixon  it s related to jfk s vp  lyndon b  johnson  i m absolutely speechless after looking through this article that johnson s name isn t mentioned  anywhere  considering he was kennedy s running mate  and there s a very famous picture of johnson smiling at a man off in the crowd who is winking back to johnson as if they re sharing some secret joke  while johnson has his hand on a bible and is being sworn in and i think it s a very possible motive for having jfk assassinated  he  would  and  did  advance to the presidency upon jfk s assassination something else i found that i stumbled across using stumbleupon com was that  according to the articles i read  which were full of hotlinks to other information around the web  according to that author  all presidents who d been assassinated  were  assassinated because they opposed  central  banking or  artificial  banking  not sure what the proper term would be that is  the fact that the federal reserve is a privately owned corporation which prints money for a fraction of the cost of the face values of what they print  something to think about i ll go look through my stumbleupon history to see if i can find the article i m talking about in the previous paragraph  but there are quotes by lincoln and kennedy talking about how they were against the  federal reserve  for lack of a better term  i m not sure what it was called historically  i doubt it was always call,0

  agree with all that is said above it may be hard for you to detect it from the noob s point of view  but the entire process may lead to the deletion  temporarily  of the current version  followed by the creation offstage of a new  cleaner and crisper article about you  purged of the promotional efforts of your publishers and the naive but well intentioned efforts of yourself and your supporters  i have discussions like this all the time with people stunned to learn that when i m in my melanti as wikipedian  my political  spiritual  literary and aesthetic opinions are rapidly trumped by wikipedia s rules and principles  which as you have recognized constitute a flawed  human effort to bring order  but not too much order  to this effort of ours to portray a chaotic and crowded universe  mayhap you will end up creating an article about the whole thing  for some poetic or academic journal  should i have been deleted held hostage at the hands of the savage wikipedians  or perhaps your muse will help you turn the experience into poetry  mutating frustration into art once more  talk  ,0

 are you kidding benghazi  libya  ap moammar gadhafi loyalists seized control of a libyan city and raised the ousted regime s green flag  an official and military commanders said tuesday  in the most serious revolt yet against the country s government the retaking of bani walid highlights the vulnerability of libya s new leaders  who have faced mounting criticism as they struggle to unify the oil rich north african nations and build state institutions from scratch three months after gadhafi was captured and killed the seizure also appeared to be the first major  organized operation by armed remnants of gadhafi s regime  adding to the security woes of the ruling national  trans itional council  the council has so far made little progress in unifying armed forces  instead it is left reliant on multiple revolutionary brigades  militias made up of citizens turned fighters  usually all from a specific city or even neighborhood the militias were created during the months of civil war against gadhafi s forces last year and when the war ended in october  the various brigades remain in control of security affairs of each city they liberated  though loyal to the ntc  they have also feuded among themselves and acted on their own initiative  and the council has been unable to control them hundreds of well equipped and highly trained remnants of gadhafi s forces battled for eight hours in bani walid with the local revolutionary brigade  known as the may brigade  which was eventually driven out  said mubarak al fatmani  the head of bani walid local council  the gadhafi loyalists then raised the green flag over buildings in the western city on monday s attack  he said four revolutionary fighters were killed and others were wounded the revolutionary brigade had kept only a superficial control over the mountain city  a longtime gadhafi stronghold which was one of the last to fall to ntc rule late last year the only link between bani walid and the revolution was may now it is gone and percent of bani walid people are gadhafi loyalists  said the head of bani walid s military council  abdullah al khazmi  confirming the fall of the city  he spoke to the associated press at a position on the eastern outskirts of bani walid  where hundreds of pro ntc reinforcements from benghazi were deployed  with convoys of cars mounted with machine guns a top commander of a revolutionary brigade in bani walid  ali al fatmani  who was present in benghazi during the attack  says he has lost contact with other fighters in the town the three officials said the attackers belong to brigade a militia newly created by gadhafi loyalists who reassembled after the fall of the regime  the fighters  flush with cash and heavy weaponry including incendiary bombs  have been increasing in power in the city  they said  a month ago  gadhafi loyalists attacked another revolutionary brigade from tripoli that entered bani walid  killing said al fatmani  now dou you see the bold part ,0

 pov language in text about anthology album cover the cited reference in the current version is just the dvd cover which is a visual image not an independent source about the matter the entire collage on all album covers is full of images that have been torn and overlaid by other images  not one single image on the covers is in its entirety the word ripped in the current version of the text is pejorative and implies that there was a motive to be defamatory to best  that may or may not be the case  as individuals we can speculate as to whether the removal of best s head was ill motivated or simply an artist s way to graphically convey what happened to best  ie replaced by starr but we can t do that on wikipedia  we can only present incontrovertible facts they are these a  all three anthology album artworks created by klaus voormann are in collage style with photographs and visual elements torn and only shown in part  b  the part of the savage young beatles record jacket in the centre of the anthology artwork that is torn is at the corner where pete best s face had been c where best s face was on the poster is the face of his successor  ringo starr  on the please please me album cover beneath it in the collage  d best is seen on the anthology cover in a separate small photograph standing in front of aspinall s van parked outside the cavern  e  the cover of best s album haymans green displays the image of best s face not seen because of the torn album cover seen on the anthology cover  the current text which has no text sources presents a pov and it must be npov  ,0

nancy  i am not after a propaganda article  i am after an accurate article  and i think that there is no serious argument that irenaeus faked the list of popes in his writings as of ad  therefore i don t think the unsupported comment by duffy has a place in what is already a quite lengthy section with regard to the mexican points  these will have to be checked  the idea that before the church didn t agree that indians hads souls  yet converted them before this  doesn t stand up  just because something has been printed somewhere doesn t mean that it is true  if the book is pov or the writer has only a slender grasp of relevant issues material can be wrong  similarly with the corporal punishment points  this is very vague and gives no law  date or time that can be pinpointed  the idea that xavier only preached among thomas christians is simply wrong ,0
 wikimarkup wikipedia has it s own special language called wikimarkup it is very important  therefore  to know a good deal of it when you begin to write an article  links external links  an external link is a link that goes to another website  besides wikipedia  they are formatted like this name of website goes here for example http w google com  becomes to display alternate text for an external link  type  name of website goes here alternate text goes here note the space between the website s name and the alternate text  for example http w google com google search engine  becomes google search engine  internal links  an internal link is a link that links to any page within wikipedia  they are formatted like this name of page goes here for example giraffe becomes giraffe  an internal link can display alternate text through the use of a pipe character for example giraffe a long necked animal that lives on the plains of africa becomes a long necked animal that lives on the plains of africa  normal text can also be blended into a link  for example  i like giraffe  s  becomes i like giraffes  internal links can link across namespaces  for example wikipedia neutral point of view becomes wikipedia neutral point of view  they can also use pipe tricks  for example wikipedia neutral point of view note the pipe character before the two end brackets  becomes neutral point of view for example orange  fruit becomes orange  redirects a redirect is a page that  if accessed  sends you to a related page automagically  for an example of this  see gill net  note how at the top of the page it says  redirected from gill net voila  for example redirect united states redirects w hate ver page it was on to united states when you ve finished this portion of the lesson  just tell me and i ll continue on to the next stage of your wikimarkup lesson  happy editing  ky ,0

i have just read the source  i think you are very right  it is about global health but again not about medical tourism which is a subcategory of globalized healthcare driven by the patient movement  for example the reference article starts with the example of dave who had traveled to tanzania as a part of global health rotation  in this case  tanzania is neither the medical destination nor the developed country with collapsed or collapsing social health care system therefore no interest to medical tourism studies  it is clearly not relevant to the medical tourism  i think if medical tourism would be defined with economics terms such as imports and exports  by the way i do not like it in this way  just to clarify we might not be so confused  like developing countries  medical tourism destinations  are the exporters and the developed countries are the importers  i would suggest to remove such texts and references which are out of topic  even though some of them are quite interesting for other studies ,0

 hi tom  the problem was after an administrator  not sure if it was you  looked at the book listings  and were happy they were neutral  about two weeks later  user decided to sabotage the book descriptions  and add on some totally irrelevant  inaccurate and slanderous ad hominem attacks on the book s author  and he inserted them at the beginning of the book descriptions to try and discredit the content with a blatant ad hominem attack  the ad hominem attacks were removed  and then accusations by  were manufactured of having an edit war when he was the one to start trashing the page after it was approved was also the one to start a destruction campaign against the separate page that the critical links and books were on before  he appears to be very fundamentalist and not too concerned about using propaganda and slander to dissuade people from seeing any critical information  his accusations  beside being ad hominem  were also completely incorrect  duffer appears not to give a damn about accuracy  or relevance  or the fact that ad hominem and propaganda are not acceptable on wikepedia  jws usually refer to this trashing and slander as theocratic war strategy basically meaning anything goes  including lies and slander  if the end result is to promote the religion  i have removed the ad hominem and i hope it will not return is also problematic in the same regard  as he appears to not realise when he is using propaganda or insults above  but is clear to see it when someone else may use it against him or jws  demonstrating his interesting double standards  a sad  but typical watch tower society characteristic hopefully it is settled now  if danny and duffer can get over their very clear insecurities about their faith  posted central july ,0

this is not correct as the british do not use the term british isles neither and i have asked a multitude of people from places like germany  australia  canada and the usa and they all agree with me  i do not see what the problem is to leave it as britain and ireland as the term british isles is considered offensive to the people that have suffered to have their independence  it is not a republic if they are being constantly reminded they are british according to the minority that say british isles  so if you want o settle this in a civilised amnner then leave it as britain and ireland,0

  davidwbrooks  i would suggest that if you have spent a month intensively editing the iridology entry  it s possible you feel emotionally invested in the task  it may be better for all if you turn your efforts to more fruitful and productive entries  instead of continually trying to add con to this pro entry  it was recently pointed out to me that some of my editions to the big bang entry were inappropriate  because an entry for a subject is the place to support the subject  not to tear it down  the suggestion was made to me that i move my proposed editions to where they would be appropriate  in non standard cosmology entries  i now make this suggestion to you  if you seek to criticize iridology  you should not do it in the entry meant to explain and support iridology  perhaps you can make an entry titled non standard iridology or maybe even fringe theories about iridology if you want to challenge the mainstream iridologists  just a suggestion  i hope it will help you as much as it helped me feb utc  ,0

i made a view explorations through the book the problem of sociology  written by david lee and howard newby  where the writers deal mostly with the notion  alienation  on karl marx  my second search was in encyclopedia brittanica student edition  where it states that the most famous use of the term alienation was by marx  who spoke of alienated labour under capitalism  this is definitely true but  it s also very useful to know that marx was highly inspired by the writings of preceding people like adam smith  david ricardo  hegel  a passage from my sociology textbook says  he karl marx  accepted feuerbach s assertion that religion was a social creation  bet he suggested that people create religion to deal with the real misery which confronts them ,0

  true  caste community related stuff are really difficult to grasp immediately given the complex nature of indian society  i can understand that you need more time to fully analyse the issue  take your own time and i am always there to help you in case you need more references we have agreed to maintain the original content till the discussion is over  an anon have edited the article without any references and you have reverted it partially  change it back to original content as of nov by the way  any updates from your side you can take your own time but make sure to maintain the original content we need to maintain the original version till the dispute is resolved  anonymous edits and partial reverting will only lead to more confusions  if people continue to edit  i propose to remove all caste names from the article till the dispute is resolved  sorry  i thought that i had fully reverted the ip  anyway  i ve read all the english items  in some cases more than once i can see that the gounder community phrase is used in the sense of meaning the kv community  but that is only apparent if there is a hook in the article to give it some context  eg  an article talks abour the kmk  you know that kmk kv  and so when it then says gounder community then the context makes it is obvious that they mean kv  i ve not explained that particularly well  but short version  yes  in the examples gounder community kv the problem is  that is not good enough  you cannot prove that the term is not used to refer to other groups of gounder than the kv  nor could i find a really clear cut example among the english language sources  all of them demanded that the reader already knew some background eg  that kmk kv party  sure  you know that but someone born bred in the uk or usa  germany or guatemala  australia and austria most probably will not  in that sense  you are engaging in synthesis  and we are not allowed to do that here you said that the tamil sources were important  are they really going to resolve the issues that i raise  in particular  is even one of them going to explicitly say that the term is used either always or most frequently to refer to kvs none of them will say  gounder always refers to kvs because there are other communities too that are using the title  but you need to view from another angle  why other communities  non kvs  are not referred as just gounder community because  all the sections of vettuvars  vanniyars  vokkaligas don t use gounder title  only some sections of those communities use the title and hence they cannot be generally referred as gounder community  this gives the freedom to refer kvs as gounder community  all of them demanded that the reader already knew some background eg  that kmk kv party this is not very difficult  we can attach this reference along with other references to prove that kmk or kmp kv party  anyway  if this not enough  here is another reference which says about gounder community  taken from deccan chronicle persons belonging to kongu vellalar are mentioned as persons from gounder community to prove that  gounder community mentioned here refers to kongu vellalar  i have attached the proof here  which says sengottaiyan is a kongu vellalar  no need to infer from kmp or kmk  this reference will directly establish that gounder community mentioned refers to kongu vellalar  user mahevenki mahevenki,0

punti and cantonese the term cantonese is the result of poor  trans literation in english  canton is the english word for both guangdong  province  and guangzhou  provincial capital of guangdong when the word canton is made into the english adjective cantonese  it could mean guangdongese and guangzhouese  the language people commonly refer to as cantonese is in fact guangzhouese  taishanese people speak taishanese  a language that is unintelligible with guangzhouese  many taishan people in china still do not speak or understand guangzhouese  this is the norm in the whole of china concerning regional spoken languages  it is acceptable to say that taishanese is one of the guangdongese languages  but then so is hakka  the conflict is thus not a conflict between a cantonese  meaning guangdongese  speaking people against a non cantonese speaking people as both peoples spoke cantonese meaning guangdongese  be it one spoke taushanese and the other hakka  neither party could also be described as cantonese  meaning guangzhouese  speaking people as neither were guangzhouese speakers at home if not about language differences  then what was the conflict about  the conflict was simply a conflict of economics  the hakkas were seen as late comers who stole the show in a declining economy ,0

 at the very least  there are many sources that study the reflectance spectra of munsell chips  one that is in the public domain is at the server was awfully slow when i tried to access the links with the ascii data files  i had better luck with click the squares for reflectance data  this website is cited in  for instance fernando ayala  jos f  ech  varri  pilar renet  and angel i  negueruela  use of three tristimulus values from surface reflectance spectra to calculate the principal components for reconstructing these spectra by using only three eigenvectors  j  opt  soc  am  a abstract the article cites the website above as ref one of the classic sources also cited in the paper above seems to be  kenneth l  kelly  kasson s  gibson  and dorothy nickerson  tristimulus specifications of the munsell book of color from spectrophotometric measurements  j  opt  soc  am abstract the kuehni book i mentioned above lists a bunch of other sources  you can browse it search inside if you have an amazon com account  used at least once to purchase something from amazon com itself here incidentally  i now realize that these sources may give enough information to settle the very question i posed  but to really settle it  i would first need the answer to the following  was i wrong in the identification of the munsell s color in my initial posting  that is what is the identity in the munsell system of the munsell color to which the wikipedia article is referring  is it in fact  rp having realized my probable mistake above  now i don t understand something else  look at this statement in the article professional artists  following munsell color system regard purple as being synonymous with the red violet color shown at right  in order to clearly distinguish purple from violet in what sense are artists supposed to be following munsell here  obviously not in nomenclature  is it the case that the artists do use munsell s colors in their work  but change the names  e g  munsell s purple artist s violet  and munsell s red purple artist s purple i d rewrite this if i understood what is attempted to be said here  ,0
 i think you have done a great job with the page  and i learned a lot from reading it and the other comments posted above i like that you were able to make use of some of the information we covered in class specifically related to this topic  but were also able to include plenty of outside resources many of the concerns i had have been addressed in prior comments  but there is one section that i find slightly unclear it may just be the way i am reading your wording  but i figure there is always a chance that someone else will take it the same way and have the same question i do in the toxicology studies section  i think your intention is to say that because the mouse study used very high doses of the protein and proteins that will be toxic are usually toxic at very low doses  evidence supports that the bt toxin is not toxic to mammals  what i initially read  however  was just the phrase research on other known toxic proteins suggests that proteins are usually toxic at low doses  further suggesting that bt toxins are not toxic to mammals which confused me by making it sound like the toxins are almost always toxic at low doses and that the bt toxin might not be safe perhaps changing this wording would help clarify your meaning for future readers just a thought overall  great job  ,0

 hi  i was just wondering why you removed my edit on the mackem rivalry page what i added  i believe to be a fact perhaps we could work on making it more neutral if you thought it may offend anyone i am originally from south shields  which is more or less equidistant from the rival cities i am currently however  living in middlesbrough the rivalry in south shields is slightly more noticable since it is geographically and socially directly in the middle  and also because it has more of a mix of necastle united and sunderland afc supporters the rivalry is especially evident in the new town of washington as it seems  i might be wrong  to have approximately an equal amount of geordie and mackem residents i don t want to offend anyone  however  i believe my edit should be included in the article in some form  as it is true that there are a considerable amount of people in both newcastle and sunderland who don t have a clue about the origins of the rivalry they tend to attribute it entirely on football  or in extreme cases  for no reason at all sometimes  whenever a geordie or a mackem makes a reference to the rivalry  i question them most of the time  their response was just don t know why  or because they are scum  and cound not give a reasonable argument let me know how you feel about this  take care  ,0

two temple place a while ago you made changes to the article i had written on the above i have no objection to any alterations you may have made to the text but i had left several spaces so that when one looked at the article the images were laid out in an orderly fashion now the images seem to be someone scattered about and the article looks clumsily put together  if you would be kind enough to have a look you will see what i mean or i hope that you will if you agree and can put the images back in the way they were laid out before i would be very grateful ,0

oswah  the article claims he was born in st petersburg and lived there until if that does not make cantor russian nothing else will  he was not german despite what that great beacon of pop knowledge encyclopedia britannica claims the impact his russian ness had in having him and his work accepted by the german school is a direct cause of his later mental health issues to deny that is fallacy and sweeps over perhaps the most critical aspect of his life i do not need any source you are my source to claim he was german is wrong period  i am a degreed historian and mathematician and bristle when i see such ignorant bias to claim him for germany he is was and will always be russian so call it like it is not as the historical revisionist want to claim it had he been any less successful i would most certainly expect german to disown him now as they did then he is only claimed by germany because of the enormity of his work and impact it had on modern mathematics something i in fact disagree with but get it right and please leave my correct correction  ,0
 whistling is right on our different philosophies being a source of conflict on other articles we both edit but in this article  it s not a question of whether merging or having seperate articles is a better editorial decision  it s a question of what the sources say the statement on singer s educational quiz certainly makes it sound like she defines fertility awareness as charting both mucus and temperature  and mentions the ovulation method as a related but distinct method whistling is right  though  that a different page on singer s website makes it clear she is including the mucus only methods within her definition of fertility awareness so this is one source for that position  and i support including it in the terminology section of this article i am not following how singer s position should override the position of the world health organization contraceptive technology and planned parenthood these are all authoritative sources  they agree with each other  and i see no reason to exclude them from this article  talk c ,0

  the succession boxes don t really make much sense in this context  the actors played lex luthor in movies and in television  with different fictional time periods  and in a number of different spin offs  each actor never really had a specific tenure of being lex luthor personally  i think a better idea would be to create a sub category of category superman actors called category actors portraying lex luthor or something similar  on the other hand  i would say that the succession boxes make sense for something like james bond  which seems to have an established centralized franchise with a rather clear timeline  talk  ,0

 re re  blagojevich copied from my talk page  no response required  hey folks  since there s two users in this talk i ll just thread this here i promoted it to itn on the reasoning that the removal of a state executive is  imo  notable whether the subject himself is or not  though i d figure it is inherent seemed obvious to me that this was more than wikinews  which is why i skipped the discussion phase as to the portal  thanks for letting me know  i was not aware of the duplication being needed in the editing  i thought it was  trans cluded learn something new every day and lastly  i still think that it should be on the main page while i can understand spencer s logic in that it needs more information to make it encyclopedic and not just news  i personally don t think that anymore should or could be added to the article on the blagojevich scandal at the time and it is a pretty descriptive article  no matter it all  thanks for the input and the learning opportunity from all three  talk  ,0

act of vandalism by krakatoa katie  this person has completely obliterated all of my contributions to the billy the kid article  krakatoakatie has replaced what had been the most detailed  and accurate  account of billy the kid s life that has appeared on wikipedia so far and reverted to an account that contains absolute garbage  this was done as an act of pure vandalism by a person that has an agenda that has nothing to do with improving the content of this article  quite the contrary the clear intent hear was to destroy that article with malicious intent and replace it with something inferior that takes the treatment back to a comic book level  i ask any board members  editors  and wild west history buffs associated with wikipedia to look at my last version  and compare to what krakatoakatie has replaced it with  i ask all of you to compare this act of vandalism by someone with an agenda  to the contribution made by someone who has a proven year  track record as a wild west historian  i hope you will all speak out and prevent this sort of thing from happening to others who are making an honest effort to improve the accuracy of wikipedia articles  please make your feelings known  hopefully you will agree that my article should be restored  thank you jack demattos,0

 the link you provide states that of the rail market in sweden is privatised that therefore makes saying rail  trans port in sweden is privatised a falsification if more than half of the entire market is still owned by the government  it doesn t matter whether the rail market was liberalised into different companies under state ownership e g  sj  something cannot be described as privatised if it retains a majority of government ownership  because it is therefore nationalised  the opposite of privatisation  to describe the swedish rail market as privatised and then list a state owned company which comprises it in the very same sentence is nonsense and this is exactly what you have written  rail  trans port market is privatized and companies include sj in this sentence you have made it sound as if sj is a private company which is untrue  since if the person reading clicks the sj hyperlink  they will be taken to an article which states unambiguously that sj is a government owned enterprise a much better thing to do would be to explain that the majority of passenger  trans port by rail in sweden is operated by state owned companies such as sj as well as the government run lokal trafik in place within each of sweden s l  n such as hallandstrafik  storstockholms lokaltrafik  sk  netrafik etc  etc  etc  and then to explain that some sectors of rail  trans port are privatised such as the  trans port of cargo  this would therefore align the content of the article with the reference you presented above  which states that the majority of rail  trans port in sweden is still government owned  with being privatised since judging by your other edits you are a right winger with a serious beef against anything government owned  you could then satisfy yourself by writing that state owned sj isn t the most efficient of rail networks  something which a lot of swedes themselves agree on as far as i have seen  in my own experience delays are common and travelling with sj can be expensive june ,0

still  it s clear that wulfila chose a lot of his spelling conventions based on those of greek  using to write a long  i was certainly one of those conventions  and another clear example is using to represent he couldn t have based his choice of on greek  because there it was becoming  af  rather than a long vowel but for he probably was inspired by greek  so what sound was in the greek of the time  was it higher than or lower  the page koine greek phonology shows that both were in fact homophones and had been already for hundreds of years before  so if he took those two writing conventions from greek  he did not take their pronunciations as they are different in gothic  that means that we have to derive the pronunciations of those two vowels from loanwords  what letters does wulfila use to substitute for in greek loanwords  and what about latin  which he no doubt knew as well  the latin of the time had and e length distinctions were probably disappearing  see vulgar latin so what does wulfila use for these two latin sounds ,0

 utc  i don t think the definition from webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written the idea that professionals supply disinterested counsel and service to others  for a direct and definite compensation  wholly apart from expectation of other business gain is a bit naive  particularly in the i think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required  for instance  in the light of holocaust  in which many german professionals acted as instruments of a disfunctional state  which would tend to indicate that service for others may not be have the intention  but was taken to a tragic extreme  likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker  if it is a profession  has shown to conducted wholly for business gain  i e  higher profit  larger bonuses whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain  often to the detriment to the business  e g  accountants in the enron scandal i am not saying that perks is the ideal source of information  but would suggest we need to cast around for a better definition  and one that is couched in more modern language  talk contribs november ,0

  it s been a frustrating set of compromises  believe me  i ve had people that wanted me to use the website name as the work field  and others that thought it the website was a publisher  i still believe that the organization that issues the chart in the first place should be treated as the author  and i finally removed that field from the citation because there was a very loud campaign from people that just couldn t understand that corporations can legally be treated as people  use of italics was another set of arguments  and there was a large segment of people that believed that the chart names themselves were things that we could rewrite to suit our tastes  the work field is the place where i feel the most comfortable making compromises  as it is inherently a desriptive field  i could compromise by changing the work field to read something like chartverfolgung simpson jessica  irresistible  album version  at musicline de and then treating the piece as untitled  because they really aren t providing a title for the chart pages  how would that feel to you ,0

  i disagree  this is a long chart and when people read this article the first thing they want to know is who was the last winner  not who won in the s  this is not a person s biography  it is an article on major singles victories  maybe  maybe if an entire chart would fit on the screen where one could look at bottom or top at a single glance it could be lived with  but once you have to scroll it is so much better to see who is the champion now right there in the first position  ,0
june utc i disagree  partially  second stage and in keeping secrets for the pretty much do not push any boundaries  with a few exceptions  good apollo  however  contains many progressive pieces  with non progressive pieces here and there  then again  i m not exactly answering the question  i judge a band on what it currently is  not what it was  given that their most recent album is imo progessive  assuming that this album is characteristic of co ca it is a progessive band ,0
 editor review hey nish  i m currently up for editor review  i would be most appreciative if you could comment on my wikipedia habits there and offer some advice  thanks in advance  thanks for the editor review  i honestly  truely know that i do not want to become a wikipedia admin  however  i hold the same thoughts towards wikipedia as i do towards the us military  given the choice  i would never join up  but my personal philosophy of national service  i agree with the idea of mandatory national service of some sort  whether it be community service or military  compels me so that i plan to join the us military in some form in the future  the problem i currently face with wikipedia is that i m constantly fighting an uphill battle in both the preservation of information and the adding of new information to wikipedia  often  something that i hope to be small edit becomes a huge issue due to vandalism  edit wars  extremely overly burecratic wikipedians  example  those who like to delete almost every image from topics under the fair use policy etc  i don t want to end up like many of the former admins who came to wikipedia to add information and stayed because they became admins and spent all their time putting out fires  however  as wikipedia will experience exponential growth within the next decade  it will plateau when the internet finally reaches into the third world in a big way and with that growth will come a huge number of vandals  honestly  i believe wikipedia now can use x the number of admins  i can t even imagine how bad it might get on here  with vandals  in a decade or so when the number of admins has grown at a steady pace but the number of vandals is huge due to the rapid growth of wikipedia and the internet in general i would prefer to not be an admin  but i m willing to put up with w hate ver it takes to preserve the good info of wikipedia while ensuring that new info can be added properly any thoughts on this edit  also  i d like to expand my vandal fighting activities  but i m not sure if i should get external programs like vandalproof  i do patrol newpages every now and then  and in the process catch many vandals  however  i usually cannot punish these vandals because of the wp agf policy and the fact that warnings really do nothing to repeat vandals  i ll try my best  alexander litvinenko you left this comment on my talk page  umm you stated that you shortened the intro here as per wp lead  we were discussing the intro on the talk page  and i would have appreciated it if you would go back and discuss the intro s status on the talk page  i am restoring back the intro section  and you can make minor changes if you wish  but please don t make drastic changes without discussing  thanks  by the way  keep up the great work with the article  hopefully we can pull this to ga or fa in the near future  best  nishkid i ve discussed the article on the talk page  the introduction is way too rambling and detailed which is why i shortened it  please read wp lead which recommends it is concise  also some of the sentences don t flow well  the first sentence was a russian security service agent  with a link to fsb  and later a russian dissident is a much better summary than was an ex fsb lieutenant colonel with kgb experience in fighting organized crime  tom in order for the article to have more impact it needs to be more concise you restored back the intro  i e  a major change and said i could make  minor  changes if i wish but  had to discuss drastic ones i hope you realise this is hypocritical  given that you did a major revert without discussing as you know  several people on the talk page have suggested to you that the intro was too long i promise you  the shortened introduction looks and reads better than the longer one the longer one does not summarise what he was in the first sentence including his dissidence  it goes straight into a narrative without any gap after working in it doesn t make sense in english his superiors had ordered for the assassination should be his superiors had ordered the assassination you can t be a dissident of an organisation  see dissident it s got several long contiguous paragraphs instead of short clearly defined ones  anyway  hope you re okay  give us a shout and we can talk about it  it was that you said  don t make drastic changes withou,0
