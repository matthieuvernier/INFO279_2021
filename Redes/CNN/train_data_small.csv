  i m not sure the etymology of the word has much to do with it  the idea of religious police is pretty common on one level or another in almost all islamic countries  it takes various forms depending on what the government decides to do  naturally  the more religious theocratic the government  the more likely it ll be a full branch of the police or even its own group  take its incarnation in saudi arabia and compare it to the village enforcement groups found in northern pakistani villages  for instance  or the versions in egypt and yemen  which have  at least at this point  more to do about making sure that the only version of islam practiced is the state sponsored one  overall  the fact remains that many islamic nations have religious police of some form or another  and leaving out the fact that it is not an institution unique to saudi arabia is inaccurate  as is claiming that it only exists in saudi arabia and iran ,0

 after studying the phenomenon of electrolysis in the anglo irish physicist g  johnstone stoney suggested that there existed a single definite quantity of electricity  he was able to estimate the value of the charge e of a monovalent ion by means of faraday s laws of electrolysis this means that chemistry is part of the definitio if the electron  the value of charge  was equated to faradays laws of electrolysis  there should be an section in the electron article on chemistry and if your going to mention obscure virtual electrons why not mention chrystal fields  because that is fundamental to chemistry if your going to mention quantum physics  why cant you mention quantum chemsitry  because i think chemistry is just as important to physics if not more important and i think there should be a section on electrolysis  ,0

 regarding consensus but wikipedia s consensus practice does not justify stubborn insistence on an eccentric position combined with refusal to consider other viewpoints in good faith  with respect to good faith  no amount of emphasized assertions that one is editing according to wikipedia neutral point of view while engaging in biased editing will serve to paper over the nature of one s activities  at times  a group of editors may be able to  through persistence  numbers  and organization  overwhelm well meaning editors and generate widespread support among the editors of a given article for a version of the article that is inaccurate  libelous  or not neutral  e g  giving undue weight to a specific point of view  this is not a consensus  from i found these passages particularly relevant you seem to consider everyone with a different viewpoint as a troll  and you continually revert edits in a way that makes sure the article is biased in favor of furries  ,0

hey  it is my judgement in the matter of david tombe that you wikipedia editors do not like to actually receive criticism  but you do like to dish it out in a nasty and abusive manner  you have to change this attitude on your part  your attitude is that everyone has to agree with the consensus  even if it is demonstrably wrong  in my experience david is absolutely right in what he says  you guys are of course wrong  you prevent correction of your obviously wrong errors by blocking this legitimate criticism  that is why your efforts are worthless and wikipedia is just not usable as a source except to cite misinformation on a topic that is being disseminated  every day i find  dumb  stupid or just plain false statements on wikipedia  i think it should be banned as it is not accurate in any way that i can determine  your blocking policy seems to be the source of the continued errors in wikipedia  i dont reccomend any one using it for any reason  it is just plain innacurate ,0

 this poorly written wiki article attempts to make it appear that ancient macedonians were distinct from ancient greeks  i would gambit the article is largely edited by people from fyrom republic of macedonia with irredentist aims towards greece  contrary to both us and un resolutions to refrain from propaganda against greek macedonians despite the occasional voice of objections there is no major dispute among most scholars that ancient macedon was inherently greek in nature at least more than anything else  the hellenic age  the greek word for what we in english call greek is evidence beyond dispute of this  to give an example of historical distortions found in this article  macedon or macedonia  greek makedon  a  was the name of a kingdom centered in the northern most part of ancient greece  bordered by the kingdom of epirus to the west and the region of thrace to the east  by saying the northern most part of greece it makes it seem like it bordered greece  there was no greece state in ancient times  there was only a collection of autonomous city states and kingdoms that self identified as greeks mycenae  athens  argos  ithica  sparta  macedon corinth  etc  another example of irredentism  the wiki article states  it became increasingly atticised during this period  though prominent athenians appear to have regarded the macedonians as uncouth this statement is very deceptive  it was common during times of conflict for greeks to label each other barbarians non greeks  as an insult similar to saying unamerican today while demosthenes used barbarians to describe macedonians  he also used it describe the athenean orator aristogeiton  aristophanes  nephelae line and even demosthenes himself as described by as a barbarian by aeschine  plato characterized the lesbian aeolic greek dialect as a barbarian register while addressing pittakos of mytilene  athenaios vi a  socrates calls strepsiadis strepsiadis was a well known athenian protagoras etc  etc  there are countless instances of greeks describing each other as barbarians  there are other examples of bias in the article but the most telling is how it lightly brushs over the hellenic period of macedon  similiar to the golden age of athens in which macedonia spread the greek language  greek culture  and greek ideas to the region  they unique flavour of macedon among greeks  was very similar to how athens also had unique aspects to it  as did sparta  as did most of the greek mini states  if macedon wasn t greek  then greek philosopher aristotle wasn t greek either  since he came from chalcidice in macedon to go down this road we would also need to rewrite a fair portion of wiki articles related to antiquity and the hellenistic period  to do this to suit the political needs of a country whose population is roughly a quarter muslim and most of the rest are ethnically slavic  who have called themselves yugoslavians  serbians  and bulgarians in the last hundred years  amounts to roughly helping the taliban blow up buddhist statues for political ends  because of political nature of the article i would advise a complete rewrite by people will credentials in ancient studies  history is not a popularity contest  just stick to the facts as we know them what s ironic is that virtually every last piece of evidence that macedon wasn t greek  is either  trans lated from greek or comes from greek artifacts  the citizens of fyrom can t even read inscriptions from macedon  as they are almost all writen in greek their own macedonian language was called bulgarian less than a hundred years ago  ,0

dutch flag the french flag was not inspired by the flag of the netherlands  this theory put forward by an anonymous user repeatedly in the last days is simply not supported by any proof and seems to be only a  chauvinistic guess from that anonymous user  actually  ironically  i found out that it seems the netherlands designed their flag in the th century based on the blue white red colors of the bourbon of france  according to the french wikipedia it is king henry iv of france who suggested these colors to the newly independent netherlands  finally  the netherlands did not have borders with france at the time of the revolution as the anonymous user wrote  france had borders with the austrian low countries  but not with the independent netherlands june utc the original colours of the dutch flag were orange  white and blue  king henry v of france did not suggest to the netherlands to use red  white and blue  the dutch started using red because the orange colour was unstable in flag making this is not chauvinism  here are some sources  http w minbuza nl default asp cms item mbz http w heraldica org topics france frflag htm tricolor http w languedoc france info tricolore htm august utc ,0

 to repeat what i d already said at ani  i am not alleging a topic ban breach  except perhaps under the broadly construed wording  i am stating that  based on the manner of this series of reverts on the automobile association followed by this  rewrite and based on the fact that highking has yet to make any associated comment at talk the automobile association  instead choosing to treat this as an issue of vandalism highking has inarguably ignored the warnings cailil gave him when he re enacted the bi topic ban about his future conduct  those can still be seen on his own talk page under the removals of the term british isles  again section on highking s talk page  so he has no excuse for not remembering them  you re going to have to read that whole thread to get the picture  but it shows quite clearly that cailil was quite explicit in what he expected from highking going forward  in addition to simply adhering to the topic ban  he must stop edit warring and start discussing  he must stop this behaviour of policing terminology on wikipedia  he must stop introducing  and maintaining by reverts  innacuracies  his altered version of the quote is not in the source  so is clearly innacurate basically  he was telling him to just go and find something completely different to do than this  because it is of no benefit to the project  what he has done instead  is just  trans fer his focus from policing usage of the term  british isles  on wikipeda  to policing the term  republic of ireland while mainaining the same bad behaviours edit warring  lack of discussion  misrepresentation of sources  misuse of guidelines policy  etc  etc  as an administrator  the onus is on you to step in and stop it  five years is long enough to be still getting away with this sort of wp te in the way you have so far allowed him to in this case  you need to block highking now until he gives cast iron assurances he understands why cailil wrote those things on his talk page  and tells you precisely how he proposes to avoid it in future  that s it  as far as evidence goes  short of me pulling out direct quotes of what cailil said to highking  i don t see what more you need to see  to do what is required of you  ,0

 allow me to start with this one even at the time  the zionist leadership denounced the massacre israel has a history of first saying sorry and later making a full investigation to add to this  at the time  there was no real intention at letting the arabs think that jew s are cute and nice people to remind you  jerusalem was under seige and convoys were being shot at repeatedly  both sides were involved in spreading that died  this does not negate the current general belief to the event which is very controvercial there s allways been israeli counter opinions that s what s so great in democracy however  they do not constitude the israelis the same way that people like walid shoebat does not constitude the palestinians if it s a matter of semantics  than i suggest we say the villager palestinians and the etzel and some isareli historions or something close  personally  i preffer my previous phrasing i d be happy to hear who are these many israelis prefferably with serious links their conducted research method and accounts of the battle to validate that they are not groups with mainly arab israeli supporters  ,0

 let s start over this is not going anywhere  except towards mediation  though i agree more or less completely with justin s edits  you both need to calm down  the spelling language issue is pointless  as are the insults  as are the reverts  and the misleading and or rude edit summaries  who cares which version is online for two or three hours  if it s going to be reverted anyway once this debate is completed  so let s focus on the debate  and leave the page at some point where we are all familiar with the content  and then do changes step by step  to improve the mood here  i think daryou should accept that there may be some spelling errors in his texts  while koavf really needs to respect that daryou s not a native speaker  and not harass him over this and i need to stop sounding like my mom  mincom  the moroccan government s own site  is of course propaganda  by every definition of the word  but that doesn t mean it can t be used as a source for what morocco s government thinks and says  on the other hand  pasting hole chunks of text from it as fact  is obviously not how this should be done inserting that western sahara was peacefully liberated by morocco is also betraying an agenda that is far more biased than your edits have been so far  daryou  i think you ve been trying to make that point all along  consistently in all of your edits  but you used to be better at hiding it questions remain above to be answered  with arguments  not reverts or insults that s my input for today  and  yes  i think mediation could be a good thing  i was hoping we could settle this one through discussion  it has worked before but i ve lost hope by now  ciao ,0

 hello  wood dickinson  i will try to clarify a few issues  i hope doing so will be helpful to you  you have presumably seen the deletion log entry  otherwise you would not have known that i deleted the article  you will therefore have seen that the reason i deleted it was logged as article that has no meaningful  substantive content indeed  the full and complete text that you posted was drifter  henry lee lucas  developing entry for this film  i wrote it and produced as well  wood dickinson reference followed by a url  the deletion had nothing to do with copyright  nor did it indicate that i don t see any value in having an article on the subject  the only relevance of copyright is that a completely different article on the same subject written by a different person was deleted three years ago  i expressed no opinion at all on the value or lack of value of a proper article on the subject  wikipedia does not have placeholder articles waiting for content to be added  as such articles are immediately visible to the readers of wikipedia  and a web page that says words to the effect we haven t written this page yet  but we will does not produce a good impression  instead  if an article is being worked on but not yet ready for publication  we keep it in a userspace page  for example  if i were to write an article on that subject then i could create a page called user jamesbwatson drifter  henry lee lucas  and move it to drifter  henry lee lucas when it was ready  i give up quite a significant amount of my time to wikipedia administration  unfortunately a large proportion of what is posted here is vandalism  trivia  propaganda  uninformed adolescent speculation  illegal content  and other unhelpful stuff  if there weren t people willing to put time into cleaning up the mess  wikipedia would soon degenerate into something very different from the very useful and widely consulted reference that it is  you are  of course  welcome to criticise any wikipedia policy  and also to express rational disagreement with any particular decision i take in the course of the work i do to help implement those policies  but i disagree with your characterisation of my administrative work as trolling i hope these comments will be helpful to you  if you have any further questions about these matters  please feel welcome to contact me here again  however  i have no intention of getting involved in phone calls about wikipedia work  especially not calls from one continent to another  ,0

both sections can and should be pared down  the criticism section is nothing more than a quote farm  providing repetitive quotes by different critics  all saying the same thing  that memri is selective in its selection of material if we pare this down  preferably to a paraphrase saying this and citing the critics as references  the response section can be pared down accordingly ,0

i do not have the book here with me at the moment is it a wikipedia requirement to not only provide a book but also page number and chapter number  etc that would put enough burden and responsibility on volunteer contributors to not be able to controbute in a practical way that would be the kind of detail you would expect from a well paid staff such as the major commercial or academic encyclopaedias have  and even in their case  i don t think they provide page numbers or greater details  they just mention the source at any rate  this book is academic  authentic and well respected naturally  it is deeply  hate d by its opponents feb utc ,0
 also  please note  i made two edits to wp since returning but prior to reading your message that i should not make edits without consulting you  in both cases they were to undo ip edits on historically sanitized articles that are regularly maintained by myself and others through undo actions  and neither contained a positive addition of content  these can be viewed in my edit history  unfortunately  i do not have a way to prove that i did not read your message prior to making those edits  however  i was with another person at the time and  if necessary  i can ask them to sign a testament of what they witnessed during my editing that could be notarized and forwarded to arbcom  please lmk if you need me to begin this process as it will take some time for me to accomplish given my current circumstances  ,0

webdirectory links you state that wikipedia is not a webdirectory  first  make a point by defining what a webdirectory is then  and what the function of wikipedia should be  since it is an online medium  the only pro for wikipedia compared to normal printed media is that it can link to pages on the internet  mediawiki is developed with that in mind  certainly up to the point where links are needed to illustrate the writing they are teherfore necessary  what you do is simply boldly delete all links you personally don t find interesting or appropriate relating to the article  in that case you can do the exact same for about other pages in wikipedia  and i sure hope you will soon find yourself asking what the hell your plan in life is  to be helpful or to annoy people  now the only thing i see you do is obstruct sharing knowledge and blocking information from the raeder by blindly deleting carefully selected  and over the years collected  external links  i had a life once  now i have a mission  i will keep on putting them all back for the innocent viewer looking for info ,0

persian origin it is a remarkable fact that  with few exceptions most muslim scholars in the intellectual sciences have been non arabs thus the founders of grammar were sibawaih and after him al farsi and az zajjaj all of them were of persian descent and they inven ted rules of  arabic  grammar great jurists were persians only the persians engaged in the task of preserving knowledge and writing systematic scholarly works ibn khaldun if learning were suspended in the highest parts of heaven the persians would attain it  the persians ruled for a thousand years and did not need us arabs even for a day  we have been ruling them for one or two centuries and cannot do without them for an hour  abbasid calip hate  there is no such thing as pan arab peoples  because how can egyptians and babylonians who predated the  arabian people  be marginalized under one group of people egyptians and mesopotamians were established civilization thousands of years before arabs  secondly  how can you deny the influence persian iranians had on the  islamic golden age  and the scientific advancements made  especially in regards to archictecture  literature  arab grammar philosophy  agricultural practices  economics etc to be fair  its unjust that muslims arabs  take most of the credit for the achievements made during that era when more than half of the scientists  scholars  intellectuals were of persian iranian origin  mplicity claims muslims as arabs ditc  ,0

article needs to be split into two  there are two different things going on in this article  one is a hypothetical discussion of what a north american currency union might look like  based on descriptions in obscure white papers from think tanks and science fiction books  the other is the origin and debunking of the conspiracy theory that such a union actually is being planned by some sort of powerful forces  the two have little to do with each other  for one  additionally  by keeping the two in one article  the citations for the first look like evidence for the latterwhich they are not  and which some of the people who provide them probably do not want them used as  the first article should be the place for discussing serious economic and futurologist viewpoints about what an nacu might be  the second should be devoted largely to a sociological analysis of why people believe in the conspiracy theorynot to details of the theory itself  as that lends undue weight to the idea that said theory is true  i suggest that the two articles be  north american currency union  concept in literature  and north american currency union  conspiracy theory  ,0

recent edits to history section hello i already posted this as part of my response on my talk page  but figured i would post it here as well  i happen to disagree with some of the information you removed from the history section of the article relating to james a  garfield  you removed information that described the relationship between garfield and instructors  administrators both during and following his tenure at hiram  i feel this was necessary in order to convey the significant role garfield played in the early years of the institution  beyond even the time that he actually spent on campus  i have seen several correspondences written by garfield on white house stationary  mind you  to burke hinsdale and other leaders of the college during his tragically brief tenure as u s  president  garfield s impact on the institution in its early years was so significant that there was even a movement within the college community back in the early s to rename hiram to garfield college in his honor  this is why i feel that  if anything  the information you removed should be expanded upon  not deleted  perhaps you were not aware of the man s impact when you removed these points  i implore you to restore them  as i think that they surely would meet your definition of encyclopedic  once expounded upon  good day to you ,0

 korean articles  hi  i noticed you were taking part in the discussion on the talk hwang seong gyeong page  i think bethereds behaviour is ridiculous and something needs to be done to stop his ownership of these pages  he said that he would change the pages back until the end of time as he thinks he is right in removing any japanese reference from his korean pages  there are many reasons why japanese katakana should be included in these pages  the obvious being that the characters are created by a japanese company and that every other article includes it bar the few korean characters is there any way to call a moderator or administrator to this debate to stop bethereds reverts  he seems to have no proper reason as to why he is omitting the information other than he believes korea is better than japan  i ve read his user page and looked at his previous edits and he seems to be doing anything he can to promote korea over japan does he not realise that in these games  even chang and kim  from kof  speak in the japanese language and have never even uttered a korean word  we need a vote or something to put him right  thanks  ,0

 first off let s be clear  this is a proposed merger not a deletion  looking at your argument of other stuff exists  the only hd specific example that you have mentioned  list of directv local channels with hd  compares the availability of affiliated hd channels between cities  not a million miles away from this page comparing channel availability between platforms  the other examples that you have given are lists per platform  as you said  the fact is hd channels on sky do form a part of sky digital and not another platform called sky  hd  hd channels are clearly labelled on list of channels on sky digital as being in hd were applicable  there is absolutely no distinction in the amount of hd content shown  if it simulcasts with an sd channel etc  on the same channel between platforms  there is no need for a list of channels in a certain broadcast format on a certain platform and it seems like content forking and listcruft  you also mentioned size  labelling this page as potentially unwieldy there are clear guidelines for the size of articles and compared to the other lists that you mentioned  this page could double in size without problems  if you want to talk long term  then in the future it s likely that being in hd or knowing if a channel uses up scaling won t be especially notable just as being in or using widescreen switching or stretching zooming isn t today and at some point this page could also end up being merged or otherwise  by the way  there is a list of television stations in the united kingdom  foreign versions may be found at lists of television channels  and i agree that it is somewhat impractical for certain tasks  as for andrewcrawford s actions  help merging explains that if you think merging something improves the encyclopaedia  you can be bold and perform the merger  as described below  because of this  it makes little sense to object to a merger purely on procedural grounds  e g  you cannot do that without discussion is not a good argument  if the merger is controversial  however  you may find your merger reverted  and as with all other edits  edit wars should be avoided  if you are uncertain of the merger s appropriateness  or believe it might be controversial  or your merger ends up reverted  you can propose it on either or both of the affected pages  a proposal had been made in august if there is clear agreement with the proposal by consensus  or if there is silence  proceed with the merger  there was silence so he did nothing wrong  with regards to darklight he did not post any kind of edit summary with his edit  since andrew does not a appear to be a regular contributor to list of hd channels on sky  hd he could have perceived that as vandalism and vice versa ,0

 there is a profound confusion in what jim is saying  maybe because he has left the movement many many  years ago  i have studied this subject in depth and spoke with current students  one of which was initiated in the knowledge just last year  this is what my research shows me  the tecniques are very simple and there is ample evidence that these are quite ancient and referred to in many practices  books and poems there is no magic or grace or opening the third eye involved  for the last years the knowledge has been imparted via a video presentation in which people come and watch an explanation of the techniques presented by the teacher maharaji  four promise are asked before the video presentation is shown  these are made verbally and no legal document signed  students are trusted implicitly give a fair chance to knowledge  don t reveal the techniques to others and keep in touch with the teachings the whole presentation last hours  as there is no group activities ot colective payer sessions or any other type of liturgy  students are free to use these techniques  one hour per day is recommended there is no cohersion to do anything  beyond the very mild promise give a fair chance to the practice  and no  jim  my sources do not include ex students  this is an article on prem rawat maharaji  not his critics  we have added a critics section because there are critics like you and it is needed for a good encyclopedic  npov article  but make no mistake  this article is about prem rawat maharaji and his movement and not about the small group of critics that you represent aug utc ,0

 pov  i removed many fewer would have been shot down if not for poor planning and inflexibility by the mission planners of strategic air command  specifically  sac ordered b s to attack from highly predictable  precisely timed  repetitive positions and altitudes  this eliminated the element of surprise  the nva were able to aim their soviet built sa guideline surface to air missiles  sams  by simple timing and azimuth prediction  further complicating the situation for the b s was the fact that sac had used the same jamming  electronic countermeasures  techniques for years  thus enabling the nva to develop counter countermeasures sac ordered the b s to make a steep turn after dropping the bombs  this resulted in an interruption in the electronic jamming of nva radars because the b s  jamming antennas  which were located on the bottom of the aircraft  were then pointed away from the radars  to make matters worse  the turn made the b s face into a mph headwind  which slowed their escape  the nva were surprised at first  but after a few nights of these repetitive tactics  they figured it out  the nva blasted several b s with direct hits  two were damaged severely and crashed near u tapao royal thai air force base  the situation would have been even worse for the b s if not for the inaccuracy of the sa system and the inexperience and errors of its nva operators sac refused to change its tactics even when shown that the existing tactics were ineffective and highly dangerous to the aircraft and crews  in part  this was due to indecision on the part of sac s commander  also  because of a top down culture which had been originally established for nuclear war by general lemay refused to listen to the suggestions of its aircrews  the lemay culture had discouraged open and frank discussion to the point that only yes men made it to the top of the sac organization where  potentially  they might have been able to prod the sac commander into a change of tactics surprisingly  nva records and interviews with former sam operators show exactly the opposite culture  realistic discussion and innovation were encouraged among the batteries  commanders  ironically  although the nva had run out of missiles by day four of the campaign  and the b s could have bombed an undefended hanoi  sac was so rattled by its losses that it directed the b s to targets outside hanoi  thus giving the nva time to reload  after that  b losses mounted again sac commanders did their best to suppress revelations about their incompetence  even going so far as to suggest that one of their critics was mentally unstable  sac has rewritten history in its official account of linebacker ii  this semi fiction is still taught at the usaf s air university at maxwell air force base  alabama  it lacks npov or sources  ,0

 dear chris  it took me a while to uderstand what happened  finally i came to a conclusion that you exploded  see your seen in the above insulting comments which i couldn t find above  if you think they are above please quote them  because we are just from different cultures  i m guessing  and correct me if i m wrong  that you just don t accept the culture like mine  you say where you stand in your own mind with einstein  landau and feynman against a world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools why do you think that einstein  landau and feynman are with me against the world  my guess  since they all are atheists who don t believe in the supernatural as you and this ironically mentioned world filled with cultists and psychologically blinded fools so we offended your feelings  and we are insulting your culture  if i guessed right  and if i did  you won t protest since it would be to stand against your god  so you have an option not to respond  please accept my appologies since i never meant to make fun of your faith  i just don t believe it is true in a scientific sense so the offense is somehow automatic if an atheist  who is never offended by someone elses opinion on the scientific truth  discusses science with a believer  i should be taught by experience  since bb proponents are always offended by my texts and until now i d never understood the reason  before i read zimbardo  that is  and learned about deep feelings of those people  deep feelings that atheits like myself don t have and that s why i ve never uderstood them earlier  if i m wrong  you don t believe that there is a god  then i have to think that you are just a fool if you are feeling offended by my disagreement to a certain scientific hypothesis  actually considered by me an unscientific but to be pc we can t discuss it anymore so suddenly the discussion became an ideological one  advice to bb folks  state up front that you are supporting an idea that there is a god and then you won t need to feel offended since no one is going to discuss bb with you  otherwise you ll be automatically offended by atheists like einstein  landau and feynman since they don t understand fully the issue and the deep feelings that religious people have  ,0

 wapipedia anyone here use it  http wapipedia org i m kind of new to it  and there doesn t seem to be a talk editing facility  so i m going to post this here  hope that s okay  their article on the prophet mohammed includes the following text by his own standards  the continuing traditions of social justice in the islamic world  of methods and knowledge of science  history and medicine as they evolved in the modern world  thanks to his profound influence driving muslims to literacy and inquiry and the prayers of over one billion muslims  many of whom pray for him five times a day  or attach peace be upon him after each mention of his name render muhammad arguably the most influential man in all history  an honour often reserved for jesus in the west  even those historians who have deplored his influence and considered it to have  retard ed the growth of its chief rival faith  christianity  express grudging admiration for the man and this to the traitors inside medina it must have come as a surprise when the strong force of abu sufyan failed to cross a trench dug around medina by order of muhammad  as the persian scribe salman e farsi had suggested to him  after the retreat of abu sufyan and his forces  the muslims directed their attention towards the groups that had committed treason to the charter of medina  the munafiqun quickly crumbled  and their leader abd allah ibn ubayy pledged allegiance to muhammad  the muslims then besieged the banu qurayza  who had intrigued against them  they had the opportunity of choosing muhammad as an arbitrator  but instead the banu qurayza chose saad ibn muadh  the leader of their former allies  the aus and this is its take on the battle of badr ce  which is markedly different to that found in the wikipedia article  which raises doubts about the aftermath of the battle on march near a place called badr  the two forces clashed  though outnumbered to in the battle  the muslims met with success  killing at least makkans  including abu jahl  and taking prisoners  whereas only muslims died  to the muslims this appeared as a divine vindication of muhammad s prophethood  and he and all the muslims rejoiced greatly  following this victory  assassinations eliminated medinans who had satirized muhammad  and the victors expelled a hostile jew ish clan  virtually all the remaining medinans converted and muhammad became de facto ruler of the city  i had the idea that wapipedia was a direct  trans fer of wikipedia articles onto wap  but it seems not  timbudds acasa ro ,0

 aztec society gidday richard  i note that you ve swapped some text about between aztec society and daily life in the aztec empire articles  i think it s fine to rationalise the arrangement on these topics  however i have some reservations about the latter of these two articles  it was one of a brace of aztec and maya articles  see for eg mayan trade  mayan food  all created around the same time in september by about or first time editors  and they all have the hallmark of coming from some more extensive essay on the subject area  i m not saying that there s copyvio involved here  my guess would be that it s almost like some joint class assignment has been broken up into separate articles  they are based on reasonable material  but they contain a number of evident misinterpretations and have more of a school essay feel to them  they need considerable work and rearranging  and in some instances i really wonder whether it is worth the effort as they cut across topics already covered in the main aztec maya articles just so as you know and something to bear in mind if distributing their contents across other articles  the images which came with the daily life article are also i believe mis tagged as the contributor s own work  when clearly they seem to be taken from elsewhere  anyways  keep up the good work  and cheers talk  ,0

 i m not an editor and dont really know how this works but there s a statement in this article that makes little sense the resulting cartridge would have the accuracy of the former for typical combat ranges  and the firepower of the latter at short ranges  this literally  trans lates to  has the accuracy of a rifle and the firepower of a pistol at short ranges  this is  i assume  not the intention of the sentence because it s not true and it doesn t make sense  because a rifle round does not  lose its power  and become a pistol round at short ranges i assume its supposed to read the resulting cartridge would have the accuracy and firepower of the former for typical combat ranges  and the increase of controllability  ease of use  of the latter at short ranges  ,0
 mudvayne  i m not one to say hey guys you forgot my favorite band of all time in the history of the world let me clarify  they are one of my many favorites  not the bestest ever but i think that mudvayne would be a good addition  yes  they may not be hardcore full blown prog by the defintion  but thats the same for a lot of bands in a lot of genres  consider nine inch nails hardcore  industrial fans think that the nin stuff is too  mainstream  to be industrial  but it s undeniable that they are definatly industrial to some extent  so what does everyone else think  prog or not  my basis is that they are very prog for the current mainstream radio rock music  even if they don t fit the definition as well as many other bands  i believe that they are a sort of representative of the genre to the more mainstream much like nine inch nails and industrial ,0

  i agree to some of your claims and appreciate your suggestions but i would like to point out that you have removed literally all statistics and some of them are clearly appropriate  i ve deliberately put life expectancy in comparison to other advanced economies to make it clear the comparisons give a clear indication of the progress s korea has made and is not a pov  you can find such comparisons in almost all economy section of country articles  such as that one in portugal  in other words  some comparisons are appropriate and should not be completely removed  as i say  you reverted all of my edits  so i did agree with some of your edits  which i left out or reworded in an appropriate manner  i do agree with the picky statistics  and removed comparisons in industrial outputs  for all comparisons made  i included reason why it is made  so it is made clear that it is not a pov  some of your claims are vague  such as due to its healthy manufacturing base which clearly points to original research  you have also removed the imf forecasts without a valid reason  which is clearly appropriate to show where s korea is heading right now and useful in demonstrating the speed at which it is growing  i do agree to the technology section and removed some comparisons  my point is that you can t remove all the statistics just because you or some wikipedia readers think it is making comparisons achievements should be recognized and the best way to do so is through comparison  if you have an issue with my new edit  please feel free to talk to me but be very specific about what you disagree with  thanks  ,0

 i can think of several citations for the personality section  most of them quotes by jafar himself  i shall list them below jafar is portrayed as a megalomaniac  jafar himself crows the power  the absolute power  who will not hesitate to destroy anyone he perceives as a threat to his own sinister designs i think it s time to say goodbye to prince abubu he wears a metaphorical mask of normalcy throughout the film  establishing himself as a cool headed schemer and gaining the trust of those around him you are most gracious my liege i assure you your highness  it won t happen again despite his rather untrustworthy physical appearance  even with this mask  jafar s villainous tendencies tend to seep through and become apparent to the viewer  particularly in the opening sequence  where jafar displays no remorse in sending gazim the thief to his death in the cave of wonders  simply proclaiming that gazim was obviously less than worthy in a rather dry tone of voice  the deleted song humiliate the boy also establishes jafar as an emotional sadist  getting a laugh out of seeing another fellow s dreams turn into nightmares one by one and treating the genie in an especially harsh manner  one only has to watch the video  a link to which is provided  in which jafar viciously tugs the genie s beard several times whilst shouting orders like do as i say it is not until jafar gains control of the genie s lamp that he fully shows his true colors  becoming even more arrogant and short tempered with his subjects after usurping power from the sultan don t talk back to me you big blue lout  you are to do what i order you to do  slave it is this impulsive behavior that leads to his downfall  as he uses his third wish to become an omnipotent genie  unaware of the life inside the lamp that he now has to endure jafar is usually shown to be somewhat comedic and plucky  giving a slightly human side to his usual malevolence  a trait not often seen in disney villains even in his times of evil and cunning  proclaiming ew  when contemplating decapitation  this  however  doesn t keep jafar from having a sub par sense of humor himself  spurting several puns in a row while keeping aladdin and his friends from getting the lamp during the film s climax your time is up don t toy with me things are unraveling fast now  boy get the point i m just getting warmed up  this comical humor does not carry over in the film s direct to video sequel  which aimed to make jafar more sinister and ruthless  though it is referenced in jafar s role in hercules and the arabian night can t think of a citation for that last sentence so maybe we should leave that out  any thoughts ,0

that s right why is that senseless division of one language to all those politically created  standards when they are to identical in all linguistical aspects  everyone normal can see that fact by looking at the chart in the article  where the standards  are compared  there are just a few words that are different  which is even far under the level of being dialects of a same language  there s absolutelly no  trans lations between serbian tv shows or movies that are broadcasted on bosnian and croatian tv  and vice versa  and there will never be  trans lations because it s same language  on the contrary  there are and will be  trans lations when one of the serbocroatian  standards  is  trans lated to the viewers in slovenia or macedonia  and vice versa  because in this case it s a matter of different languages  not accepting the facts that serbocroatian is one language is a totally pathetic behavior  limited to the extreme nationalists  especially from the western part of this language speaking area  they are totally isolated  always fighting unsuccessfully with the rest of the world  and their failed propaganda is dying every coming day  the majority of croatians  bosnians and serbians are  thanks god  normal people  who are absolutelly aware that they are speaking a same language  which is  by some suspicious political reasons called either serbian  croatian  bosnian  dalmatian  montenegrin or bunjevac  those are the facts  and no oposite comment can change them  regards to you tsf and to all the majority of normal people on these pages ,0

 dithering here  i m sorry we haven t met sooner there is another you may wish to acquaint yourself with his name is user tharkuncoll  an anglo saxonist english traditionalists  even the pro celtic  pro roman  are apparently the bane of the british isles here at wikipedia  but i don t know about that in real life  considering such a sentiment is supposedly more tolerant yes  it s said to be more accepting than the proud teutonic approach to english identification  although it seems as though the celtofascists here are trying to spin the english alone as foreign to the isles  even though it is easy to discover the celtic origins in roman europe  especially the brythonic kind  as much as anglo saxon european ties are to the post classical rome of charlemagne and other holy roman germanics they think that pro celtic  pro roman means hostile cultural appropriation  as they have identified you as the other the big pink elephant in the room it is a sight for sore eyes to see how you manage to reconcile hostile  mutual exclusionary factions of celt  roman and german  for most people involved in these articles have one agenda to push or another  but hardly any singular romanists  i m afraid perhaps i should try that imagine the double whammy of negativity from the celto germanicists ahh there s no way to achieve anything in any of this without some bloodshed  it seems incidentally  if you d like to get worked up elsewhere  go check out the archives of that talk page here  for instance in that article  it is apparently considered nonsense by  that the greeks bestowed the name british isles upon that set of islands off of gaul and that is the ultimate origin  as they instead focus exclusively upon the tudor stuart settlement  extreme violation of wp weight and barely even narrowly wp synth  so wrapped up in violations of wp nor which modernised the term and put ancient ethnic vagueness into political effect  nor do they care to see that roman britain was only that part of albion  that part of the bi in total which had been conquered or annexed through treaty by rome  even as erin would go free not contradicting the fact that they are both british w hate ver that originally meant aside from the trojan story just about any and all bi related pages are vicious black holes and often  the only way to go about it  is by using extreme caution and wisdom you will find that whilst your attackers see fit to add and add as they wish  their abuse of you is based upon their own convictions of what they would like to edit one way or the other and if you don t fit their profile  then you are wrong not just what you happen to do or write  it is a personal vendetta to expunge all of your works many times  after selecting a target  they are simply being difficult and if they are lucky enough  they will have provoked thee into becoming banned  just to see you squirm  as they do w hate ver it is they wish  to put the spin on this or that subject  according to their absolutist truisms of course  you are unable to do anything about it when your editing privileges are revoked and the admins won t even bother to level the playing field for you  only acquiesce to their demands based in vilification and lynchmobbery they will  most likely  base their complaints upon improper procedures which is orwellian codespeak for we don t like what he stands for  let s overwhelm him in numbers all said  it is very nice to meet you you  like me  with a youthful tenure here being quite deceiving  would probably enjoy this a lot i ve been a fan for the longest time  of you  tharkuncoll  ,0

i do have a well defined purpose in mind  to generate orthogonal projections of n dimensional uniform polytopes into k space  maximizing the distance between the image of any j facet and that of any non incident  k j  facet  nearly all of the higher polytope images in wikipedia are aligned for maximum symmetry instead  this means or at least can be approximated by excluding some bounded pieces of the grassmannian  and finding the  points  furthest from the excluded pieces a tractable mental image of the space that contains the exclusions would help after another look at operator norm  i have a slightly better idea of the shape of my problem just enough to see a flaw in the most obvious approach  and not enough to see a practical way around the flaw  ,0

  lol  gee  i wish you were part of wp canada i ve tried to raise the issue of their irrelevance before but got shot down  rather patronizingly too they re supposed to be parallel to people from whatcom county or people from oxfordshire but the reality is that regional districts are not anything like counties are  especially not in terms of any self referential this is where i m from sense unless you mean all people from x categories in the case of regional districts  which have only existed since and also do not include indian reserves in their governance  and have extremely limited powers  sewer  zoning  some planning and disaster management they re not relevant to historical figures or anything to do with indian reserves or people from them  some users  like user backspace  and i  got into something like edit wars over his her labelling objects like mountains  lakes  etc with them  and similarly provincial parks are not managed or classified by them in any way  different branch of the governance system  namely ministry of environment there s also  y see  forest districts and forest regions  land districts  which are the legal subdivisions but without governmental relevance of any kind ministry of environment regions  for parks theoretically but bc parks  has its own system within moe health regions  hospitals  etc school districts  counties which are for the court system but largely irrelevant to daily life development regions  which are relevant to daily life and provincially kept statistics  though tey re formed from aglloomerations boundaries of regional districts but separate from them administratively and bc tourism  http w hellobc com  has its own system of regions the rationale provided by the regional district categories defenders is that because it s the system that statscan uses to divvy up bc for the census  i e  counting people  then it makes sense to use them as geographic subdivisions for where people are from but it just doesn t make sense the problem now is that there s all kinds of mirrored wiki clones which ahve statments like x mountain is a mountain in the such and so regional district though the more relevant reference is in the such and so mountain range or in the x country valley in bc there s lots of historical region references of the nicola country shuswap country omineca country type  sometimes capitalized  though often not  and often just the shuswap the okanagan the omineca etc  and regional district names  and also electoral district names  are often built out of them e g  columbia shuswap  okanagan similkameen  but i ve also seen  trans lated categories articles saying fraser valley when meaning the fraser valley regional district  the problem is that only half of the fraser valley is even in the regional district of that name  the rest is in the greater vancouver one and similarly the cariboo regional district doesn t include all of the cariboo  and itself includes a region known as the chilcotin i ve created categories for most of those areas  and a parallel hierachy for same  but have been challenged about that because their precise boundaries can t be cited easily  even though they re what people actually use and historically pre date even the province itself there s some subcategories using that format e g  category people from the similkameen  where the similkameen the similkameen country and also category cariboo people  although that s largely intended for historical figures from that region s glory days during the cariboo gold rush and since in the way british columbians actually talk  so and so is from the thompson nicola regional district would mean that that person works for the thompson nicola regional district most likely an official or bylaw enforcement person myself  i d like to ditch this particular group of categories entirely but have yet to garner consensus for that  the rationale is that some other long ago wikipedian created the hierarchy and so we should respect that even though that person  to me  was utterly clueless and shouldn t have created them at all the only thing the main rd categories should be used for is the component municipalities  though there are some electoral areas that have articles  but ti s when those start getting used as geographic descriptors  it s entirely offbase  it s all over googlemaps and wikimaps  too  and it s really annoying to see  similarly the use of the french form of indian reserve names has similarly been borrowed and pasted all over hell s half digital acreage because it s what statscan  wrongly  uses as if statscan were the only classification system and as if real people talked like bureaucrats in ottawa do anyway sorry for the rant  it s been rare for me to find,0

 this is a pointless argument  nobody ever makes the choice between progressive and interlaced video at the same line count and refresh rate  because they are applicable to different situations  you might as well say that bits per pixel images reduce the bandwidth to half of bits per pixel  for a given resolution this may be true  but it s not likely to be useful  because the bpp image simply has half of the bpp images s information removed  and so is appropriate for a different set of purposes  talk  ,0

 double standard reloaded who is interested in debating and who is not  who is interested in developing the article and who is interested in freezin it to death  including using threats and veiled censorship in the form of selective double standard applying of internal rules after all  it never too much to remind that  an editor besides not been unwilling or unable to counter argue  over a year and a half  he also have done baseless statements about editions done by me in a certain rude tone  during all this time  i have responded to him in the same mode  but especifically to these assertions  not having any left unanswered  unlike him and only me is who was warned and  block  curious  summary of operations to the newcomers in this discussion and also to the selective forgetful ones see above the heart of this case  as well as the sections spurious quotations  once again  and sections warning to judge by yourselves ii in my talk page to note that from grammatical objections to the size of version that i propose  no one objection was left standing and even so it continues to be reversed even taking into account that the present version incurs spurious quote in the  st paragraph too detailed and redundant information  for an article that are supposed to be short on the  nd paragraph and incomplete besides be longer  vague and non neutral in the  rd how not to think in double standard when the last disruptive revertion  besides be longer than the version i propose  was based entirely on incorrect inferences and historical misconceptions as i shown above  again  see above points a to e in once again section that were related only to the  nd paragraph  of the version i propose and that no word was uttered against or about the spuriousness that was purged of the  st paragraph  as well as against or about the  rd paragraph  that according to some editor  ctr f on word solid to see above  on the discussion about grammar in the once again section was pretty solid and even so  the revertion was done so  i again ask you all is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances in the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral  which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime  monarchical  military  etc w hate ver be worse  which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above even if this purposes are involuntary  although the time that passed without actions having been taken  as well as the resistance to remediation maintained  only makes this possibility  of involuntariness  unlikely which group of honest editors  ladies and gentlemen  who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument  would vote against such remediation or would omit about it ,0

 first sentence hi there  thanks for the edit  i really appreciate you helping to improve the article  i have something to say about your edit  however  and i wanted to take you aside a moment and work this out the problem sort of exists with the original too  and i ve been trying to think what we can do about it  see  a sizable chunk of people still do know it as  the alien from alien and our job is to correct those people when they look it up its a problem with the article i was planning to tackle after the xenomorph issue was settled  if it went that way the way you have phrased it sounds like its just some uncommon secondary name  which is not ideal  but neither was the way i did it basically it needs to say you might know this as alien  but you would be wrong but in wiki language  i ve hit a brick wall with how to do that  i m hoping you might have some ideas for that do you think we could work out some nice sounding way to introduce the article a bit better than it currently does ,0
 trivia  last time see this edit  in which who edits little else besides this article  this section  claims that there is consensus on this talk page for this horrible selection of trivia  the trivia here is nothing but insignificant mentions and some other tripe  including an originally researched claim that it s close to some location in a th century novel  just to indicate the level of encyclopedic discourse  and what can only be described as a combination of trivia and spam in the link to the scp foundation web site  w hate ver it is  i mean  i ve seen some trivia in my time  but this beats almost all of them  i ll let it stand so you can see how trivial it is  even though it totally rubs me the wrong way  so here s what i propose  we take care of this once and for all  in the above linked diff  kothog claims consensuswell  there isn t  there s a bit of discussion  but nothing like consensus  so i invite every interested party  including previous participants  to settle it  names i see on this talk page who have discussed this matter include proposal in agreement with wikipedia practice  common sense  with wp trivia  with wp v  and with wikipedia in popular culture content  i propose that the trivia section  or w hate ver it s to be called  will contain only entries that are rigorously verified with reliable secondary sources as to correctness and relevance  just that it is mentioned isn t enough  it needs to be established that it matters ,0

 having worked in radio for years in the harrisonburg  virginia area  and having worked for wacl rock  for years  ending in i have respectfully asked that the format information for this station be changed to reflect it s official format  which is classic rock  the station s official format is classic rock  not rock  album oriented rock and not active rock  i received this response from users who will not allow me to edit the content myself i talked with that other user and he said since wacl makes no clear distinction in its marketing  and based on the station website and group website  it doesn t  either rely on the arbitron listing  which is derived from the station s own reporting it should fall under the rock label  not aor  or classic rock  just plain old rock  i will make a note in the article that the station plays a blend of classic rock and active rock neutralhomer talk in my opinion  the accuracy of the content depends on fact  not on how the station markets itself  and not on wikipedia users  opinions of what the station sounds like  the station does  in fact  rely on arbitron when creating sales pitches to their advertisers  and arbitron lists the station as classic rock because the station has reported to arbitron that it s official format is classic rock  having an extensive amount of professional experience in radio in harrisonburg  virginia qualifies me as an expert on this particular subject  again i ask that the following changes be made to the content on the wacl article  wacl fm rock is a classic rock formatted broadcast radio station licensed to elkton  virginia  usa  serving the harrisonburg staunton  virginia  area  wacl is owned and operated by clear channel communications history  the station first launched on february with the callsign wpkz  during that time  the station would carry a country music format  branded as z on march the format was changed to classic rock  branded as cool to accommodate this  the callsign was changed to wacl  on may at midnight  wacl changed their branding to rock on april wacl began carrying the syndicated radio program nights with alice cooper  when it moved from wbhb fm at fm  now wtgd  to wacl fm at fm when the format had been switched to classic country music  wacl plays a blend of classic rock and active rock  the current content is completely inaccurate and non verifiable  because i am an expert  i am considered a verifiable source according to wikipedia  allowing inaccurate information to remain in any article on wikipedia goes against what wikipedia is all about providing true and accurate information that is not based on point of view or users  opinions  ,0

  i would really like to begin such an article  i believe it can be created and it could be a great article  there are many people who don  t practice a religion  yet have opinions about the morality of homo sex  acts  for instance  in my high school  whenever we had a debate about homo sex ity and someone was against or in favor of the acceptance of homo sex ity  the arguments used were never religious  and yet a discussion about the morality of homo sex ity would happen  maybe those comon arguments could be in this article  like the common view that it is not natural to be  gay  and therefore it is wrong  and the common answer to this which states that we all do things which are not natural every day  like driving a car and using condoms  or the other answer which would see it as being natural  the same sex marriage article has some of those moral views independent of a religion  ,0

 april utc the inquest nb this was originally posted  by a different editor  under talk hillsborough disaster missing from this article  but i m moving it to its own section so it doesn t get lost currently the article does not convey the fact that a new inquest into the hillsboroguh fans  deaths has begun  changes to the article are likely to be actually controversial or be seen to be controversial for the next year or so  regardless of source  new facts may emerge into the public domain as a alarge amount of documentation has been made available to the coroner  for this reason  wikipedia editors might be best seeking to lock editing for the duration and to seek expertise regarding how to edit without interfering with the inquest  preceding unsigned comment added by the above is probably one of many reasons why this article should be locked for editing  given the topic immediately above this one  this article has already been raised at wp an  lets defer to the admins common sense and judgement for the time being attempt articles relating to high profile court cases are not normally protected see wp protect for policy  this is partly because this a private website based in the usa  the us and uk rules on freedom of speech during court cases are rather different and wikipedia like other organisations doesn t take kindly to people outside the us trying to apply their rules to it  also  there are plenty of wikipedia editors who are quick to remove material they see as inappropriate and editors have this article on their watchlist  this can work very well see above for how quickly the offensive material was removed from this article so i expect the default will be to carry on as normal unless problems arise  if they do  there s a whole range of measures that include blocking particular editors from wikipedia or barring brand new or unregistered editors  the elephant in the room question  was this match an all ticket affair if so  how many of the had tickets if they did have tickets were they purchased from reputable retailers the great unknown about this disaster be the matter of tickets if only those supporters who had purchased legitimate tickets through reputable outlets had turned up on the day the odds are this disaster would never have happened speaking as a scouser this may sound traitorous to some  but  it be the one big question that has never been answered  preceding unsigned comment added by reads the article hillsborough disaster build up states on match day  radio and television advised fans without tickets not to attend now get down from your trollbox  dick laurent is dead ,0

radical departure from traditional banking practices this article doesn t convey the sense that check is a radical departure from the way banks have traditionally worked the cancelled check was a key part of traditional checking the cancelled check is proof that a drawer has payed pursuant to the terms of the check not only do you have proof  but you have the original paper and the original signature this is a right that bank consumers have  that has been taken away from them by special interests  check nullifies attempts of banking consumers to protect themselves from banking fraud it is no longer possible to inspect the original paper of the check experts cannot inspect the original signature or the ink used on the checks watermarks are no longer useful  nor are special inks  microprinting  or other security features that were designed to stop check fraud  check eliminates obligations banks usually had to their customers  it is a radical and profound change in our banking system  and it introduces lawlessness and chaos into our banking system ,0

  condo to prevent unecessary redirects t z  not sure the recent edit changing tyler from anarchist to nihilist is accurate  tyler certainly does have a ethos and creed  where as a nihilist does not  his creed can certainly be said to be destruction of the current culture and certainly retrograde in many respects  seeking to return to a simpler subsistence level of existence  i e  hunter gatherer  but he definitely has an established ethos and world view  it is simply contrary to much of modern society  i posit that the edit should be reverted back to anarchist apr utc reader s digest  jack joe hey  a few years ago i was reading a really old reader s digest and i swear i actually read an article written first person from an organ s point of view  i don t remember which and the guy s name was joe this was before i read the book  so i just thought it was a really odd coincidence at the time i can t seem to find the article anymore  though does anyone else have any info on this was joe changed to jack to avoid legal troubles with the original joe s x author the author of the book was talking about real stories from reader s digest  so you probably did read the same ones he refered to  joe is changed to jack in the movie because reader s digest wasn t willing to allow them to mention it in the film lgagnon  i have a copy of john pekkanen s article i am john s brain tumour from reader s digest  south africa volume number chapter of my copy of palahniuk s fight club has i am jane s uterus  i am joe s prostate i am totally joe s gallbladder isbn vintage uk random house  the english rd sites i searched came up empty  the earliet joe  s i found were two videos  from pyramid films i found that pyramid media credits it to rd does anyone have a source of an actual reader s digest article with joe t z it is mentioned on the commentary for the dvd that reader s digest told them not to use joe apperantely they own the copyright somehow  either way  the narrator in the book does use joe rather than jack  and given that the book is the original story  i believe that joe should be used more often in the article than jack though the narrator fits the character s name more accurately the article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie  which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book  it would be best that we keep the article based mainly on the book  with details on the movie where applicable  otherwise  what we would be doing would be the equivelent of someone making the lord of the rings article more about the peter jackson movie than jrr tolkien s work lgagnon  tyler section we should merge the tyler durden section into the characters section  there isn t a need for separate sections on him  as it is it looks redundant and a bit sloppy  any details that don t fit that section can go into a different one lgagnon  backstory of the novel i just recently updated the article on chuck palahniuk with info on how fight club came to be  this is in the first paragraph of the biography section  i was wondering if anyone thought we should include that info in this article  since it gives the backstory of how it was written  talk jul utc musical this this for real  i ve never heard such a thing  can anyone offer proof user kneeless aug utc see http w playbill com news article html for more details  also a recent guardian interview aug utc movie book balance as i mentioned above at the end of the reader s digest  jack joe section  the article is biased towards the movie  that is  the info for the film is treated as being the primary source instead of the book and needs to be balanced equally for the book  i have fixed a recent re write of the plot section  which made it even more biased in favor of the film but more work could be done to balance the article  i think that fixing this is the most important o,0

ok  sorry for the delay in responding properly from what i can tell  the bare facts of the matter are that you made edits to a number of lds related articles  and those edits were reverted by various editors  myself included now  there are two main ways of viewing these facts  one  that your edits were consistent with wikipedia policy and the editors who reverted them were not justified in doing so  two  that your edits were not consistent with wikipedia policy and the other editors were justified in reverting them this is why i asked you about your understanding of wikipedia policy  you are relatively new here  and despite your confidence that your edits were appropriate  my view of them was that they violated several policies and guidelines  it s natural for newcomers to take some time learning the ropes  so it doesn t imply any malice on your part  since the heart of the conflict seems to be how you and i regard your edits in light of wp policy  it seems best to isolate the points of policy where our understanding differs  in hopes that we can establish areas of common ground from which we can work out other differences  or at least agree about what we irreconcilably disagree it would be helpful  though  to know that you ve indeed read the pertinent policies  so that we can speak with the same lingo and refer to the same general ideas have you done this thanks  talk ,0

  if this was a legal wiki  you might have a valid point  it s not  so you don t  why don t you get a ruling as to whether plain english can be used on this wiki  the lede is supposed to encapsulate the rest of the article which is quiet clear that this was a murder not an accidental  natural or judicially sanctioned death i do sympathise and understand that for sinn f  in and the provisional ira  the current phase of the conflict is about the definition of the conflict itself  for the self esteem of the so called republican movement  and for the political future of sinn f  in  it is vital that its year campaign of violence be remembered as a just war  a regrettable but necessary method of achieving a legitimate aim  the vile and sordid deeds that run through that campaign may  under pressure  be described as wrong  they may be accepted as mistakes pira may acknowledge  in the curiously passive language it favours  that these things should not have happened but they must never  ever  be called crimes  god forbid kiwiexile at dmoz moved here from his talk page at vintagekits request result of pira investigation why exactly do you think that the views of pira should not be fairly represented on wikipedia in reference to the  presumed death of jean mcconville i am rather puzzled as to why you keep excising my new section referencing  the pira statement on the the abduction and killing of mrs jean mcconville in december dated july by p o neill  irish republican publicity bureau  dublin  is it just because you are still editing carelessly and without respect to other editor s work by just hitting the revert button when you see  naughty words  such as murder and pira however  i must congratulate your improvement in tone  if not the quality and care you take with your actual edits keep up the improvement kiwiexile at dmoz ,0

 edit that sparked controversy  there is no consensus for a reverted edit that i made in this article  hereafter the reverted edit therefore  i have not changed this article unilaterally back to my previous version  because that would be against consensus this reverted edit was reverted by killerchihuahua  kc  who not only disagreed with it  but also said  in her edit summary  that the edit was disruptive i disagree with kc that the edit should have been reverted  for reasons already explained above i also disagree with kc that this edit was disruptive  and i will now fully and carefully explain why  for the record  this edit that kc reverted was clearly not redundant to any previous edits made anywhere else at wikipedia  and thus this edit was not made by me in bad faith as part of any disruptive edit war this discussion of rcog s position on choice started at the article on fetal pain  and i moved it here for valid reasons at the fetal pain article  kc wrote please provide a source that this government institution is  pro choice abortion is legal in the uk  and that the official govt  chartered college are to make that safe is not pro choice  i therefore investigated and learned that rcog is not a government institution  that most of their members live outside the uk  that its governing documents do not specifically limit its activities  that many of its members do not have medical degrees  et cetera so  i concluded that the best place to deal with all of this would be here at the article on the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists here at the rcog article  i added quite a bit of info  in addition to rcog s abortion stance  when i was at the fetal pain article and decided to move to this rcog article  i repeatedly said so in the fetal pain discussion  i did not sneak over here to try to avoid objections at the fetal pain article kc has elsewhere cited five diffs that she says prove this controversial edit was virtually the same as several contested assertions i had made previously  here are kc s five diffs in the fetal pain article in the fetal pain article in this rcog article in this rcog article  and in this rcog article none of these five previous edits cited by kc is the same  or virtually the same  as the reverted edit that sparked this controversy both kc s diff and diff show where i inserted a cite to support another editor s assertion that rcog is a pro choice group kc pointed out very clearly at the fetal pain article that she did not think rcog was a pro choice group even though she thought rcog could have a pro choice position on particular issues there is no uncertainty or ambiguity that kc argued rcog may have a pro choice,0

regardless of what you believe  it s not part of the definition  so it shouldn t be phrased as such now  apparently  you want me to teach you economics fine payment of wages for labor is an emergent phenomenon in free markets  a number of things happen technology advances  which increases the return to sepcialization interest rates and average profit margins decline both of these make it harder for one person to have all the skills to competitively run all parts of the business so  people start to sell just the input they re  comparatively  best at  that gives people a much higher return for their efforts than investing money at interest  or trying to do all functions of the production process well  but we really shouldn t be using the talk page for economics lessons ,0

 the problem is the wider we cast the net in terms of subject matter for the article  the more room there is for disagreement and debate energies are dispersed  and the article becomes lopsided and uneven read the article on human skin color this article discusses the various theories about human skin color one scenario is that fair skin is the result of spontaneous  random mutation  that  theoretically  there were white skinned people  the result of genetic mutations  in africa  but they simply did not survive to produce progeny  that the same mutations occurred when humans migrated north  but because of the climate  those mutants survived to bear and rear offspring another scenario posits that humans initially were pale like simians  but as they began to lose their hair  their skin darkened over time as a climatic accommodation and there are other theories  as well you want to get into melanin in this article  and the accompanying sturm und drang of agrument  disagreement and  potentially  more edit warring  just look at what s happened here with a far narrower piece and for material that eventually will be cut out  anyway the mechanics of melanin this still reads like a phenomenally bad idea  ,0

 candidate for deletion this seems like a serious article with some serious problems  the lead pseudophilosophy is a term  has no sourcing  the lead  and especially the first paragraphy of an article  is like a definition and therefore requires sourcing  the body of the article is sourced  but it s just a list of where pseudo philosophy has been used before  but does not justify the lead  i tried myself to quickly find some reliable source that would justify the lead  but couldn t find anything  the section accusations against popular philosophers should probably be removed the way it is now  two of the entries are un cited and the rand citation is by a writer of unknown qualifications  also  i can see this section degenerating into a philosophy i  hate  list  the article seems to me  the way it is now  to be a candidate for deletion  ,0

 jehovah s witnesses related question hi jeffro i don t remember ever actually writing any wikipedia comments before  so forgive me if my formatting ends up wonky  i was just looking for lists of watchtower publications to help me with my collection  when i stumbled across this page and section https en wikipedia org wiki list of watch tower society publications primary study aids  https en wikipedia org wiki talk list of watch tower society publications study aids  the heading these publications are intended to convert interested individuals struck me as a bit jarring and out of place  for one  the immediate next header is secondary aids are considered just before or shortly after baptism so it is not even consistent  secondly  i am not sure that i agree with the talk page reason you give for keeping the header  as it includes original research  private interpretation of primary sources  and citations of a publication that might not even apply to all of the books listed  e g how does a s kingdom ministry support the statement that studies in the scriptures is intended to convert interested individuals thirdly and lastly  making statements about intent is always notoriously difficult and subject to conflicting interpretation  while making statements of fact is much simpler and should be preferred  with that in mind  a possible alternative header might be something like these publications are generally considered prior to baptism it is concise  clear  consistent with the other headers and doesn t make assumptions about intent  only fact  may i have your thoughts you have previously commented at wikipedia talk pages  and you had mastered wiki formatting such as indenting at the time  you also referred to yourself in the third person a few times  i hope you ve recovered from that oddity the intended purpose of the  bible study  program offered by jehovah s witnesses most definitely is to convert individuals to the jw faith  though the students are not told of that goal at the outset of the study  for example your goal is to help the student achieve greater insight into the truth  qualify as an unbaptized publisher  and become a dedicated and baptized witness of jehovah our kingdom ministry  april page chapter of what does the bible really teach pages your alternative wording would therefore be misleading  because the students don t start out with any intention of being baptised as members of the religion they just think they re  learning more about the bible your wording would only be suitable if the order of events was a  a person wants to be baptised as a jw  b  they study the necessary literature  c  they get baptised  i have added references to the article supporting the fact that the publications are used with the goal of converting individuals  pediainsight can you supply diffs of plagiarism copyvios  if that is genuinely what the user is doing then i have this shiny banhammer in my tool belt  guy for a few examples previously indicated  see user talk pediainsight citations  more recently  his edits at homeopathy plagiarised an extract of dana ullman s book  if you d like other specific examples  please advise which ones  line breaks thanks for your contributions to the tonga adventist article  a minor point  you have been removing line breaks from the end of sentences  see wikipedia manual of style accessibility text  do not insert line breaks within a sentence  since this makes it harder to edit with a screen reader  a single line break may f,0

is it perhaps not true that  before fiat money  inflation was adding one or millions of monetary units to the money supply  with the advent of fiat money what you call creating money out of thin air  a reality or fact that you are in total denial about  although the whole world economy operates like that and there is no sign that it is going to change even more in denial than you accuse us mainstreamers of  so prices rise as the result of a complex of economic activities  at the same time the money supply increases as well as a third factor operating at the same time  that is  actual new wealth created in the economy  since only a specific level of money supply is required at any specific level of wealth in the economy  the rise in the general price level indicating inflation  is the way inflation is revealed as well as measured ,0

  wasn t aware you would be working for me by adding a toc if that s your attitude then don t edit wiki at all  because every edit benefits someone  your adoption of that form of wp battlefield attitude is what i mean before  your  rr block log shows your unwillingness to collaborate because you are self serving rather than community serving no personal attacks from me either  only observation of your misdeeds and mass scale bad faith reverts  also you defined the editor who toc d the cat as an spa but wp spa and arbcoms specific def  on an spa does not support your statement  so perhaps that s another example of your hostility towards ips and new editors  you are very aggressive  and the ownership like behaviour you have placed on these articles in your own interest rather than wiki s is all too evident  there is no point my beating about the bush  i m honest  you re a bad faith editor who misrepresents policy  uses it to his advantage and ignores the wider benefits of doing something good and chooses to argue instead  i ve remained perfectly civil with you  despite your intolerance and oppressive mannerisms  i don t work for you  but you chose to make my edits as a personal afront to your standards  rather than those set out by the community  you reverted articles without even knowing what you were reverting  the eric fleming article being a laughable example that you were bul reverting without a care for who or what you harmed  foregone conclusion is simple for anyone to see  you don t like ips newbs so you wp bite them harshly  rudely and subjectively with undue force ,0

kmccoy  i agree with you  if you look at my changes today  i included only the birth dates of the two children who are now adults  one of whom has a wikipedia article already  with three independent sources for track s birth date of april and i included the birth date for baby trig  since he was so much in the news last year  i was trying to find a compromise position  there is no consensus here for including or for excluding  and  if you read previous talk pages  you will see no consensus there either in the spirit of erring on the side of more information  wikipedia s mission is to inform  after all i made today s revision  the immediate reversion  wiping out all birth dates  except that of little tripp johnston  certainly the most irrelevant birth date of all is a bit risible and does not demonstrate any consensus either  as for the sources  i shall find better ones  but that argument is a red herring  no one has found any other birth date for track other than april all the sources  weaker or stronger  agree on the birth date i have read wp undue  it supports including neutral factual information  birth dates fall into that category  i really don t see where the problem is here  i shall not continue to include the birth dates in the article  but this demonstrates that wiki articles need more consistent management  it is troubling that there is a small minority who insist upon exclusion when wikipedia should stand for inclusion ,0

wade park the whole point is that the park is much more than the museum  it s more than of a square mile so it s a significantly different entity from the museum itself because there s no article on the hd  we shouldn t have its infobox anywhere at all granted  we shouldn t have a stub for the sole purpose of filling a hole  but we also shouldn t pretend that another article fills that hole either  you are partially correct in your assertion made in the edit summary for the wade park article the park isn t the entire district  but you are also partially incorrect  you re saying  the park itself is not the district  and the national register database indicates that the park isn t even part of the district  where that i underlined is where you re erring the nrhp website lists this  roughly bounded by e st east blvd chester and euclid aves cleveland acres buildings structure  http nrhp focus nps gov natregsearchresult do fullresult true recordid http w nationalregisterofhistoricplaces com oh cuyahoga districts html unless we are looking at different nrhp websites  and you haven t either spent time in cleveland or  at the very least  looked at trhe area in question on the map  then you re not taking into account two three things the acres includes wade park  google map it the name wade park district explicitly  and even implicitly if you re familiar firsthand with the history of cleveland and this is related to my second point regarding a familiarity with the history of cleveland  jeptha wade s property  which is where wade park is and the heart of the district in question  was the seed from where all the buildings in the district sprung from  the cma  botanical gardens  natural history museum and severance hall  which all are part of the district  would not be there if wade park wasn t set aside to be the cultural epicenter that garnered it s nrhp entry lastly  given that any one of the buildings listed on the registry are technically part of the wphd  there would be no false information by including the nrhp infobox on any of those articles  which was my entire point of putting it on the cma article in the first place  the infobox being clearly labelled as wade park district is not misleading by including it on a building that is part of the district  we could argue about this ad nauseam  but what s the point of course i can make an entire article that covers the district specifically  but why just regurgitate the same stuff found in each individual wikipedia article that exists for every building that is in the hd  including the wade park itself bandwdith pollution notwithstanding  it is simply redundant  or we could make it less redundant by simply putting the infobox in one of the articles already out there  and the wade park article being the namesake for the hd would make the most sense  the article is hardly complete  and could be expanded to include an entire section specifically about the hd and relationship bewteen the two and if not that article than the cma which is the largest building in the hd  and the reason i put it there in the first  either way  the underlying question in this argument that i have for you is this  how is it productive in our task as wikipedians  and moreover as members of ohio specific wikprojects  to keep adding and removing factual info from articles with direct relationships to the subject of our debate  are we trying to make wikpedia a more informative user based encyclopedia  or are we nitpicking over how to make a piece of factual information  that is an important part of a large us city  available to those who are looking at wikipedia for information ,0

live aid the bbc retraction was not a small ordinary retraction  it involved many  many bbc stories stretching acrosst several of their programs  wikipedia cannot be a credible encyclopedia if it leaves things like this out  i dont care if it is just a single sentence or two sentences  but it has to be in the article otherwise i is a sham of an encyclopedia  i didn t repeatedly add stuff in there  i actually removed a bunch of my writing  and then modified the writing of someone else who had added similar stuff to what i had added previously  please check the history  i disagree  and as i ve already explained to you several times  both on the article talk page and on your user page  the bbc has retracted many  many claims and stories  and this one is no different nor is it notable in any way ,0

map  no doubt footnote no correctly ascribes the information on the map to the who but clearly the who is not the appropriate authority given that the un as we all know deals with countries  self reporting  may i point out that malaysia and indonesia  which are described as muslim countries  as they officially indeed are contain very substantial christian  buddhist and hindu minorities see the cia world fact book moreover  many such minorities are considerably to be identified by region  north borneo and new guinea  for example  are very large geographical areas in malaysia and indonesia which only have a marginal muslim presence  the moluccas in indonesia are at least christian  bali is famously hindu  overall  malaysia is some muslim and clearly does not belong in the plus circumcised category as it appears on the map  but given the geographical spread of these countries and vast disparity of cultures and religions across the indonesian archipelago  it is surely meaningless to describe these countries in such a way  one is reminded of the generalisation in a former version of this article as to aboriginal australians based  it seems  on certain academic studies of remote communities which did not at all constitute a valid observation as to aboriginal australians as a whole ,0

 question question this is a bit beyond the policy proposal  so i hope you do not mind my asking here you have sparked my curiosity what do the entries in my logs and user rights changes have to do with anything there that is to ask  how did you come to that conclusion best  mercury at how can i mind  i brought it up in the discussion  i was checking your user rights log to see if you had been a checkuser  forgetting that the cu flag doesn t seem to appear there  when i saw that you seemed to have some problems with another mercury along with a number of strange actions taken on your account  a second block  a sysopping after a voluntary resignation  blocking yourself for vandalism  an otrs deletion  etc i still don t understand what all that is about  but it had made me suspect that you ve been the target of vandals  i thought it might explain why you seem so anxious to get this draft policy approved in such a hurry  even though almost none of the people to be charged to execute it had commented i haven t been back yet to see the current state i was trying to express my understanding toward someone i thought might have a personal need for the policy  but in retrospect my comment sounds more like some vague insinuation  for that  i apologize  talk ,0

franktobia  i am sorry to say  but when you say the debt can be paid off you are  in fact wrong  because of one and only one thing  the application of interest by the federal reserve that is applied to the only money printed and in circulation  so that fact being true in all terms  the debt will never be able to be repaid to that which is the federal reserve bank  if the debt were repaid  the money would cease to exist leaving no value in the monetary system  frank  im sorry to say that the only banking book that is a valued resource is the book modern money mechanics written in by the federal reserve bank  also  if you look at the shareholders of each fed bank they will all lead back to the same people  mostly located in europe  by saying that the federal reserve bank system does not work for profit  yet they apply interest to all loans derived from them as a source is really denying that you are credible in any way  and im not saying this as an insult  but the only reason of interest to be applied is to make a profit  feel free to reply to this at any time or email me at randomrd gmail com  i will be copying this and reposting it daily to prevent editing ,0

 they have looked only at the effects of collision on hd there are hardly any equations  they are not interested in quantum description of the whole process but only on what happened with the hd  from which they read about used slit s but please respond  does the hellium go through the slits as a wave or as a particle  the copenhagen interpretation discretizes experiments  during one  it must be either the former or the latter  if it is a particle  then it has a position or momentum during measurement  subject to uncertainty  they arise upon measurement  according to orthodox copenhagen  and arise randomly then  there are also things such as momentum  trans fer etc  which are usual for particles  if it is a wave  however  then it can interfere  and also it can be in many places at a time during measurement  but in this experiment both momentum  trans fer and wave effects happen during one process of leaving a slit  so please admit that the experiment shows something that is against the orthodox copenhagen interpretation  already for this reason it is worth mentioning here but there is one more point  if you take the bohm s interpretation  which spreads properties such as charge or mass in space  if the article is not mistaken  and then apply the guiding equation not to one selected point  but to all continuum of points within the orbital  then you can easily explain how can something that acts as a particle go through both slits at a time  the interference pattern will arise due to similar effects as in huygens  principle  momentum  trans fers from points  integrated  of course  because normally they will have only something like density of mass and thus density of momentum  will also follow normally  this looks like a quite natural explanation of the phenomenon  especially that photons most likely encounter the same thing when they bounce from shutters between the slits  etc  a very natural explanation is  then  that the apparent particle subject to all qed equations etc acts proportionally with its whole body can be normalized to like with orbitals  so that the body does not extend infinitely in space every point follows its own way  when confronted with potentials of external fields  for instance  as in qed though they have a common wavefunction and this makes them one and the same particle  but this emergent interpretation  so natural and obvious  will never be compatible with the copenhagen interpretation and the like  which assign certain probabilities to different outcomes of a measurement  this is why ci needs the distinction acts as a wave acts as a particle in experiment  in case of a particle you will have position or momentum  subject to heisenberg s  and in case of a wave you don t take these into account  so no problem  but never  in ci  you have a continuum of measurements for a certain wave function  because  then  without any collapse in between  all possibilities would have to occur  otherwise i don t know how do you understand the word probability  you will not have an explanation why these other points are still with the wavepacket and have not flown elsewhere  for such an explanation  you would have to introduce a causal component which actually cancels all your probabilities and  thus  all the individual life of the points of an orbital  this causal component exists in the bohm s interpretation  applied separately to the points because the guiding equation will make the points go in such a way that the centres of probability are observed in choosing direction  and thus the points will keep close to the orbital  they will not escape  thanks for reading this and please restore the paragraph  maybe with some deletions  because it enriches the article and is even easy to understand and admit  don t hide the facts ,0

 a quick thank you for being objective and doing the right thing most of the time  back on that british national party talk page  i still dispute the links cites sources to the independent  i m trying to get everyone to go through this step by step logically  the first step being to link to an article on the independent website that even discusses bnp membership figures  the note link cite about the bnp membership figures  just links to the independent homepage surely it needs to go to somewhere better  so the quality of the article can be debated talked about a lot better  also the resistance on that talk page  isn t neutral  of course they can talk about the article but they should not be editing it  if they are politically active in the uk  for example another one is https en wikipedia org wiki user snowded if you look at talk about at dinner section of his webpage it s obvious that he s politically active in the uk and would be diametrically opposed to the bnp  ,0

 vitamin b some edits by user mrt lack proper references and are factually incorrect  the claim that bacteria are the only sources of vitamin b vitamin b is false  it is produced by a unicelular alga by example  pleurochrysis carterae  http w ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed fortified breakfast cereals don t offer vitamin b vitamin b from plants  they have it added as a supplement  it is recommended for vegans to take supplements as such  as a minimum dosage can be reliably maintained  the human gut also contains b synthesizing bacteria  living from the mouth to the anus looks false  the old reffered study  http w ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed only reffered to small bowels and it was falsified since  http w beyondveg com billings t comp anat comp anat  c shtml claims of intestinal b production may be based on insufficient evidence  albert et al is sometimes cited as evidence that b producing bacteria can exist in the small intestine  sometimes explicit claims are made  e g that intestinal bacteria allegedly can produce adequate bitch baker and nutrition reviews are related citations that comment on albert et al however  a careful reading of albert et al shows that it used bacteriological assays  which are of lower reliability  to measure b levels  specifically  the most accurate bacteriological assay they used is ochromonas malhamensis  note that ochromonas is the most accurate bacterial assay method for b however  even it may report values for some analogues as part of its b results  schneider and stroinski tables to pp herbert and das p apparently regard all the bacterial assay methods as being less reliable than differential radioassay  also see herbert et al and herbert for related information  additionally  the data obtained in albert et al comes from isolated bacterial cultures  therefore  it is unclear whether the bacteria would produce similar amounts of b under the conditions present in the intestines  this point is discussed in albert et al but is sometimes ignored by dietary advocates with an ideological interest in minimizing the requirement for b in the diet  the bottom line in the paper of albert et al is that it shows certain intestinal bacteria might produce bitch but it is unclear whether how much might be produced  and absorbed  under actual conditions in the small intestine  the last paragraph contain only straight propaganda from md personal pages contradicting the necesity of the vitamin  without any reference to reliable sources the editor was also part of a dispute on the vitamin b article http en wikipedia org wiki talk vitamin b pov issues preceding unsigned comment added by talk contribs algae acquire vitamin b through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria individually  algae and bacteria make interesting organisms to study  bacteria are organisms that can be found living in a range of different environments  besides being organisms capable of causing disease in humans  they are also vital to the cycling of nutrients within the environment algae are organisms capable of fixing carbon through photosynthesis within aquatic systems at the same time they are important to study because with increased nutrient loads to bodies of water can cause algal blooms  which can lead to eutrophication  this reduces the amount of dissolved oxygen available for use by fish and other aquatic organisms bacteria and algae can coexist within biofilms biofilms can help reduce the effects of external factors to produce areas that can allow for growth of specific bacterial populations and make conditions favorable for certain bacterially mediated processes such as denitrification  your source however  didn t exactly say that b is produced by a unicelular alga  it said talk ,0

  what you were up to  you mean  from the beginning you re personally attacking me and harassing me  and this is the only way you found to try to claim ownership of articles  and yes  it s highly suspicious that you seem to monitor everything that happens between the ip and me  at worst  it shows that you re actually tracking down my edits  ie harassing me  at best  it proves you are the ip because without any communication with me or the ip  there is no way you can be aware of anything in so much details unless you re harassing me and no  that you happen to hear about this matter right after it occured  while nothing suggested you were active here for days  cannot be coincidence  and finally  please  buspar  stop playing on words  this is what the admin that took in charge your ssp case stated  and nothing else looking at contribs  user buspar and user xuanwu are very probably the same user  technically  they cannot be socks  as one username was created after the other stopped editing this statement is based on the technical definition of sockpuppetry  meaning that a person is using different identities at the same time  the admin only noted that the accounts were not used simultaneously  but nonetheless acknowledged that buspar and xuanwu were the same person looking at contribs  user buspar and user xuanwu are very probably the same user  the admin  however  never confirmed that you were not the ips onethirtyeightdot suspected you to be  if you ve seen the line no  buspar is not then please source it correctly so  what do we have an admin confirming you re likely to use several identities  an anonymous ip acting in exactly the same way as you do  having the same personal issues with me  editing the very same articles as you do  reverting back into articles the very same contribs that you made  and it also seems both you and the ip seem to have a telepathic link allowing to know every issue occuring with the ip without you being contacted by it beforehand as i ve said  i m offering to peacefully resolve this problem i am sincerely convinced that buspar is the ip  because i ve noticed the very same edit pattern  because both users contribute to the same articles  and both users seem to have a personal issue against me and both seem to systematically revert my contributions as soon as they concern article about illegal downloading  thus  this is not randmon bad faithed accusation  this is only what i sincerely believe however  if it is absolutely proved that buspar and the ip are not the same and that buspar and the ip don t behave in similar ways  then i m ready to make excuses to both users and to stop identifying the ip as buspar  but if someone has any doubts about the ip identity  or if someone clearly acknowledge that buspar and the ip have the very same behavior and edit pattern  then that s all i need  i won t continue to call the ip buspar  on the condition that an admin clearly acknowledges the ip  as being buspar  and that buspar in his future edits  only revert edits of mine and talk to me under his buspar username  ,0

  here is the explanation of the legal side of capital maintenance as quoted directly from the capital maintenance concept and share repurchases in south african law by f h i cassim and rehana cassim  the capital maintenance concept the south african companies act of adopts a strange and a curios ambivalence towards the nineteenth century common law concept of the maintenance of the share capital of a company  in some respects  the companies act still clings to this archaic and outdated concept  while in other respects  it boldly sweeps away the concept and replaces it with the more modern twins tests of liquidity and solvency as a form of creditor protection according to the capital maintenance concept  the issued share capital of a company is seen as a guarantee fund or a permanent fund intended for the payment of the claims of the creditors of a company  with the result that the issued share capital of a company may not be reduced  nor may it be returned to shareholders except where the companies act or the common law authorizes it  thus  lord halsbury  l c in the ooregum gold mining company of india ltd v roper declared that t he capital is fixed and certain  and every creditor of the company is entitled to look to that capital as his security this was echoed some eight decades later in cohen no v segal where the court  in prohibiting the payment of a dividend out of share capital  proclaimed that w  hate ver has been paid by a member cannot be returned to him and no part of the corpus of the company can be returned to a member so as to take away from the fund to which the creditors have a right to look as that out of which they are to be paid  the capital may be spent or lost in carrying on the business of the company  but it cannot be reduced except in the manner and with the safeguards provided by the statute  in accordance with this concept  ss and of the companies act prohibit a company from issuing its shares at a discount unless certain stringent precautions have been complied with  section prohibits a company from paying interest on shares out of share capital unless this is authorised by the articles of association of the company or by a special resolution  the interest paid is restricted to a maximum of six per cent per annum  and the approval of the minister of industries  commerce and tourism has been obtained  f h i cassim ll b cum laude ll m  um laude university of the witwatersrand  johannesburg  south africa  advocate of the high court of south africa  associate professor of law  university of the witwatersrand  johannesburg  south africa  consultant with bowman gilfillan inc  rehana cassim ba  cum laude ll b cum laude university of the witwatersrand  johannesburg  south africa bowman gilfillan inc these statutory provisions find their roots in the capital maintenance concept  but it no longer makes any sense to preserve them in their present form  because instead of complying with the burdensome requirements of s a company may now simply make a payment including dividend payments in terms of s as amended in whether out of capital or profits  to its shareholders provided that this is authorised by its articles of association and that it satisfies the tests of liquidity and solvency as explained below a company may  if it so desires  prohibit in its articles of association such payments section abandons the common law concept of capital maintenance and together with it the fundamental common law principle that dividends may only be paid out of distributable profits  unlike english law  ss and which regulated reductions of share capital have been repealed by s of the companies amendment act of with the result that there is no longer any statutory procedure for the reduction of a company s share capital  expect in accordance with s of the companies act  perhaps this conflict in the underlying philosophy and policy of the south african companies act is a direct result of the patchwork and piecemeal reform that has taken place in south african corporate law during the year existence of the companies act of by way of contrast  ss of the uk companies act have preserved the statutory procedures and regulations relating to reductions of share capital  share repurchases another vital aspect of the reform of the capital maintenance concept is the right conferred by s of the companies act  as amended by s of the companies amendment act of to enable companies to purchase their own shares  until south african corporate law was one of the few remaining common law jurisdictions which continued to pr,0

this is a very inaccurate and well poisoning characterization i am biologist with a strong background in philosophy  mainly focused on ethics but of course broadly on metaphysics  epistemology and political philosophy as well  at this point in my life i ve gone back to school specifically to get a degree in philosophy and no longer even work as a scientist  so for you to cast aspersions of scientism is wholly unfounded  i don t think dawkins should be called a philosopher for two reasons he is not referred to as such in philosophical publications  at least not enough that it is justifiable to call him a philosopher outright per wp v  and he does not work within the traditions of any established academic disciplines of philosophy that is  he does not attempt to deconstruct language so as to understand and analyze its meaning and to subsequently determine through rigorous logic the truth or falsity of propositions  as he would if he practiced analytical philosophy nor does he fit into the traditions however broad of continental philosophy granted  he does write about subjects that are within the pursue of philosophy  but he does not do so in a philosophical style now  i ll fully admit that the there is a sort of demarcation problem here  and so my second point should only be considered an aside to the first point  on my first point  i d be happy to include it in the article if dawkins was characterized as a philosopher by a more than a couple mainstream  philosophical journals or by a substantial number of mainstream  academically practicing philosophers ,0

 i have tried to proceed in a reasonable manner  clearly you are not reading my post  did i or did i not state that these are definitions from a classical chinese dictionary  have you bothered to look this character up in a proper chinese dictionary  you think the omission of being unsettled is intentional do you i feel unable to continue a reasoned discussion when faced with such an attitude  uneducated argumentum ad ignorantiam perhaps you need to read up on what argument from ignorance actually means you also don t seem to appreciate the verifiability issue relating to ancient chinese pronunciations  but you seem to simply refuse to appreciate any point that i raise  so i shall stop trying  good day  talk ,0

 eagle scouts are expected to set an example for other scouts and to become the leaders in life that they have demonstrated themselves to be in scouting  as such  they are disproportionately represented in the military  service academy graduates  major professions  business and politics  this statement is not at all supported by the citation  the citation only mentions statistics about people who were scouts not specifically those who reached the rank of eagle scout  since scouts are undefined in the source we are left to assume they are claiming that anyone who spent a single day in the scouts is to be considered a scout and thus they statistics are biased  however  this is incidental  the main issue is that the stats don t relate to eagle scouts at all  so  the citation is a prejudiced source and it does not cite a neutral source for the statistics it claims  the two sentences about disproportional representation in major professions w hate ver those are  are unsupported and the tone does not seem at all neutral  since it is not supported by the citation or any real world statistics  i suggest it be removed completely unless a neutral source can back it up  ,0

most of us are sympathetic to your personal story  and we understand the importance to you of your relationship with endal  however  as you have noticed  we have guidelines for what can be included on wiki  i have been working to make the endal article conform as closely to those requirements as possible  dogs that have long pedigrees are not  at the moment  but things may change considered to be notable on wiki  wiki  however  is quite fluid  and there may be a time when pedigree histories are considered important enough for an entry  the reasoning behind the argument for inclusion of the endal article on wiki is not your relationship with the dog  nor its pedigree  it wouldn t matter if endal was a mongrol but that there is a considerable amount of media coverage  that the media coverage has been prompted by yourself has caused some alarm  and some questioning of the article especially as you started the article on wiki yourself  it just looks like a vanity thing and we do get a lot of that on wiki some people don t quite get that this is an encyclopedia rather than a free home page for w hate ver they fancy putting on it  however  regardless of who started the article  i feel that the amount of coverage that has been generated by yourself for your dog gives it a certain amount of notability  as you are so close to the subject  there is the question of original research and other wiki principles that may be broken  i would strongly suggest that you refrain from editing the article until you are more familiar with wiki procedure you may just push it into a decision for deletion either now or some point in the future  yes  endal can be submitted for future considerations for deletion passing the current discussion does not make it secure as you have some interest in dogs  would you be interested in looking at the current dog articles we have on wiki category dogs  and seeing if you can improve those  warm regards,0

 oh hi  long story short so i won t be ranting or what not  this time so sjones is wikihounding me constantly for nearly a year now  and his pal bridies is also obsessed with me to the point of where the great most of his entire activity here on wikipedia in the months was all about how to rid of me  while i ve substantionally adited hundreds of different articles during the same period  over in total since march that s just not normal  btw  right now i m  block  because i referred to this wikihounding by stalking which is just semantics really  apparently they call it cyberbullying now outside the wikipedia now  gas  basically what the devil s advocate wrote in his comment and this example of the so called additional evidence as it was called by sjones in his wikihounding thread  is indeed a good example of evidence as it shows what is actually this problem with me and it s that i actually know  and obey  all the policies  rules and guidelines  including but not limited to everything regarding gas and their reviewing process while many reviewers don t know  and even when they re informed about the rules and guidelines  the proper ones  because in this case the reviewer was misinformed by some other apparently uninformed users  strangely including at least admin  they might even flatly and completely refuse to acknowledge and use them  here  the reviewer s invoking ignore all rules instead of admitting the wrong i m all for proper reviewing  instead of incorrect arbitrary  which is why i ve opened this thread recently  aftter this very debacle  precisely  because the scale of this problem  various types of bad reviewing  is pretty alarming  and some reviewers  blatant refusal to play by rules after they re being informed about them is just absolutely unacceptable  that s my opinion  at least  but i can t see how could i be any wrong with being right ,0

 definition  tabin this proposal  i will discuss why the wikipedia definition for probability  is not a good  valid definition  and needs to be changed  probability is something that is used every day  it is what helps us further understand the outcomes of the events in life that are uncertain  however  in order to further our knowledge of probability  we must truly understand the definition of the word first  according to wikipedia  there is not a clear  valid definition for probability  and i propose to change this user nparibello njitwill summer probability  tabthe given wikipedia definition is as follows  probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain the proposition of interest is usually of the form will a specific event occur the attitude of mind is of the form how certain are we that the event will occur the certainty we adopt can be described in terms of a numerical measure and this number  between and we call probability the higher the probability of an event  the more certain we are that the event will occur  thus  probability in an applied sense is a measure of the confidence a person has that a  random event will occur the opening sentence brings great concern as to what probability really is  it begins with  probability is ordinarily used to describe an attitude of mind towards some proposition of whose truth is not certain  the word ordinarily is not only ambiguous  but makes the opening sentence tell us very little about what we are reading about  aside from the ambiguity  the rest of the sentence is extremely confusing as well  although i am someone who has studied probability not only for my college degree  but also on my own to further my knowledge  i still had to read that sentence over and over again to understand what the writer meant  i would not consider probability an attitude of mind  because this simply does not make sense  the proposition of interest and attitude of mind are unnecessary and confusing when defining probability  probability is the analysis of the outcome of an uncertain event tabthe given wikipedia definition gives several examples of what probability is  rather than defining it  it states that  the proposition of interest is usually of the form this is not only an example instead of a definition  but it is an extremely poor example  the word usually is very vague  leading the reader to believe that the given example does not apply to probability all of the time  the definition also ends with probability in an applied sense  but what does that really mean  because there are no other examples of another sense that probability applies to  this makes the definition unclear  tabthe definition then goes on the describe probability in mathematical terms using the range between and for anyone who has not dealt with probability in a mathematical sense  this definition most likely makes little sense  the way it is written is very vague  but what it is trying to say is that there is a range of outcomes in probability starting from the event will definitely not occur to the event will definitely occur these ranges are also often written in percent form to i believe that by adding the fact that these numbers are percentages  the numbers already start to make a more sense and become more valid  the range between these numbers is the percent of likeliness of an outcome  while this definition gave many examples that do not help the reader to further understand probability  i would perhaps include one common example when dealing with the mathematical sense  even though definitions should not include examples  for example  the probability of a fair coin landing heads after it is tossed is or this is because there are two possible outcomes  heads or tails  and both are equally likely  if the coin had been unfair with heads on both sides  the probability of landing heads would be or since there are no other possible outcomes  as stated in the original definition  the higher the probability of an event  the more certain we are that the event will occur  tabtwo good quality sources comes from richard l  sheaffer in his book  introduction to probability and its applications  and glenn shaffer in his book probability and finance  both sheaffer and shaffer are well known mathematicians whose textbooks are used in a vast majority of colleges  including njit  both of their main mathematical focuses aim a probability  making them two of the best sources for this proposal  from a mathematical standpoint  richard sheaffer states that probability is a numerically valued function that assigns a number p a  to every event a so that the following axioms hold  p a and p s glenn shaffer explains these axioms in a more wordy  les,0

 problem is this i  too can see that it could have been an honest mistake however  him attacking me shows he has no agf he even denies making the edit the correct response would be for him to give an excuse of an error  whether or not it is an honest excuse attacking me is not the solution having administrators attack me shows they are not fair they should have tried to mediate a solution which might be it s possible that this was an honest mistake whether or not is was  the user did make the edit despite his denials at this point  we ll do nothing please  everyone be careful when editing instead  people attack me when i was the one who discovered the wrong information  ,0

 the first paragraph of the article ends with the term racialism is sometimes favored as a less negative term by those who hold certain beliefs about race that they believe to be scientifically justified  two problems the way this sentence is currently worded  it assumes the validity of the concept of race  when in fact that term is problematical because of the way most people interpret it  there is no clear indication of what believers in racialism believe  other than that they believe their beliefs are scientifically justified  it s also unclear whether these believers are even a reasonably coherent group  or whether for some users of the terms it indicates a belief that  e g people with a recent african heritage are more likely  statistically  to have sickle cell anemia and therefore need to be screened for that disease  and for others it is just a cosmetic improvement on racism nov utc  ,0

 it is true that lots of more modern arts hang without frames  but the signac paintings are years old  and even contemporary art in a wikipedia article benefits from frames in their presentation to the viewer  virtually any image benefits from lines echoing the delineation of the  usually rectangular  image  this is somewhat similar to the way scare quotes call attention to a word or phrase  the scare quotes are setting off that word or phrase for special consideration  we have a vested interest in trying to get the reader to take special notice of each image of artwork that we include in an article  if we are going to argue that wikipedia is not an art gallery or that these thumbnails are hardly impressive in their dimensions and scarceness of detail  then why bother including images of famous paintings at all  i think we all agree that the images are all educational in an art historical kind of way  therefore it seems like a poor move to reduce their usefulness to the reader by removing the framing lines and the emphasis those lines impart to the image  ,0

 there are still many fundamental problems with the string theory and its successors  m theory etc i mention just three problems which a good theory of everything  toe  should solve a good toe should be able to formulate its own principles and fundamental equations  moreover  these principles and equations should clarify and simplify our picture of the physical world and allow some testable predictions  as far as i know  nothing like that is still available for the string theory  m theory in contrast to its rather long development and far reaching claims a good toe should allow  calculations of all interaction constants and particle parameters from its fundamental principles  it was actually one of the original einstein s goals to give some purely geometrical or mathematical origin to fundamental physical constants  no variant of string theory is able to calculate these parameters from some first principles if the toe is formulated in some space of higher dimension etc as expected  there should be also a unique and justified principle of compactification e g a principle how to project the structures from the dim world to our tangible dim world  in its contemporary status super string theory is very fuzzy and umbiguous concerning the compactification  in my opinion  the very word theory is rather premature in connection with the  super string theory and einstein himself probably would not be very happy with its present form and claims  ,0

the problem i have is that from my understanding  london  the region of england is the exact same thing as london  the city  both are conurbations and have no administrative role within uk government  this article is currently suggesting that  london  as a city is only a convention when really  there is a legal entity know as  london the region which effectively acts as the capital city of the united kingdom  i agree that greater london and london are separate entities  and deserve separate articles however currently there are two articles cover the same region known as  london i think that the region known as  london  should removed from the greater london article and this article should show that london is a region commonly described as a city  regards ,0

 team roster moved from user talk kevin mce  hi there  i wonder if you might be able to clarify your reason for making this edit where you cited wp crystal  i m not clear on why the information you removed is inappropriate  thanks  i don t know what needs to be explained we cannot say with certainty that those riders will ride for that team next year  because we do not know the future an encyclopaedia reports facts  not expectations  hi again  firstly  i moved your comment back here to keep this in one place so it is easier to follow  i am still not clear exactly what at wp crystal makes this content inappropriate  this is not a predicted team roster  it is verifiable and very likely to be accurate since the chance of team sky confirming they have signed a contract with a rider for and then that not happening must be very slim  it is verifiable that these men have signed to ride for that team next year  that is in the preceding paragraph and i would not challenge the appropriateness of stating that a roster  not a word that should be used on an article about a uk subject  but that is a different matter  is not something that exists in and even as a speculative list  it is so incomplete as to be meaningless  it also does not use the cycling squad template which is standard for team articles  but these are not the point returning to the crystal balling issue  you say yourself that the chance of them not riding is very slim  you thus acknowledge that this is a possibility  and therefore their inclusion in the squad is not a definite fact let s hope it doesn t happen  but sky might go bust  or any one of the signed riders might have a career ending injury  before january  in which case will arrive  they will not be part of the team  and the encyclopaedia will be guilty of having recorded an error facts  not expectation  i will happily accept that the signing of a contract to ride for the team in doesn t mean that any of these will actually ride for the team in and that the team might not even exist  however  all these riders have been signed up to ride for the team in that makes them part of the squad for we re not simply expecting them to be  they are confirmed to be  surely though  we would be speculating if we were to disregard that and suggest it might not happen  i think you are misinterpreting wp crystal  i d suggest that it makes it clear that it is perfectly acceptable to include details of future events providing the information is verifiable  as is the case here  if it turns out that any or all of these riders don t ride for team sky in then the wikipedia article won t have been guilty of having recorded an error because it was an entirely accurate description of the situation at this time based upon the information available  i m not saying that it won t happen  nor that it is not very likely  but that it is expectation  not fact you speak of verifiability  but life teaches us that the future is not verifiable if they were to die before the end of this year  they will not be in the team  the future is not confirmed an entirely accurate description of something that does not currently exist is not possible  and as a description  a man top level racing squad is not entirely accurate i find your position on this matter a little strange  you seem to want to defend the article from speculation but in doing so  seem to be introducing your own speculation that the team might not exist or the riders might change  the names that are being announced are for the squad  so it seems perfectly appropriate to describe the list as such  we can  and should  only base the article on what can be verified at the current time  and that is that the riders named are part of the team for the information we have at the current time says these individuals are confirmed to ride for the team in and our article is  and should  only ever be based upon information available at the time  i would note that  not only has another user reverted the change you made which i am concerned about here  but also that a further ten names have been announced,0
 ethnic violence i think the following paragraph should be removed from the article it has been suggested that the random violence was a delayed response to crime perpetrated by other middle easterners  such as gang rapes that occured in and my main problem with it is that the claim being put forward is totally unsourced and unsupported  yes  whoever put it in has provided an article from the australian as a source  however  if you actually read this article  it doesn t say anything of the sort about the violence being some kind of delayed response to events in and in fact  it only mentions rape once  here is the relevant section of the article in an article on this page nearly two years ago don t turn a blind eye to terror in our midst  january i argued that the increasing frequency of racially motivated attacks on young australian men and women including murders  gang rapes and serious assaults by young men of lebanese muslim descent would rise dramatically throughout australia  these problems remain widespread and have been documented in the ensuing two years so no mention of any kind of delayed response  therefore  the idea is completely the pov of whoever wrote it  hiding behind a misrepresented source  it should go  ,0

  binksternet s paranoid and frightening theory propounded about geraldine edwards is both unwarranted and inappropriate  he has no grounds or factual element to support his theory in general  which is pure conjecture and supposition  what s more  it s not his place within the rules of wikipedia editing to mount a personal editorial based on his personal feelings towards a person  his hypothesis that a rouge ip editor from san diego mounted a campaign to raise the profile of geraldine edwards to the level of bebe buell  slander mary ambrose  and attach geraldine edwards to the creation of almost famous is so preposterous as to be laughable  other wikipedia editors who have tried to defend geraldine flemming mueller against binksternet s attacks upon her were met with threats leveled by him  his interest in geraldine flemming mueller is unhealthy and alarming  and it would be in his best interest to step away from this situation altogether  as he fails to maintain a neutral stance  which is one of wikipedia s precepts  on the subject of her  that being said  geraldine edwards is not a  hoax she s simply a woman who s living the life she see s fit  and is not interested in being included in wikipedia articles  and finally  posting any inappropriate  hostile information against a living person that may harm them is clearly being flouted by binkstenet s many malignant comments posted on wikipedia s pages regarding geraldine edwards  one of the main guiding principles of wikipedia  it s time for him to stand down  the san diego college angle is still quite active with regard to geraldine edwards  see user talk zabadu geraldine edwards is not a hoax which was started by the ip registered to san diego state university this writer said approximately a couple of years ago when mary ambrose was visiting san francisco  she met binksternet  and they became friendly  a statement that is complete bunk  nothing in the ip s post is supported by reliable sources  all of this effort to defame ambrose and build up edwards is astonishingly trivial  it is a waste of my time  a waste of mark s time and a drag on wikipedia to have to deal with it  as long as there are no reliable sources to back up the allegations  they must stay out of the encyclopedia  editors who repeatedly disrupt wikipedia are usually  block binksternet  talk w hate ver  binksternet gives new credence to the phrase legend in his own mind although i respect many wikipedia editors for their diligent  accurate and commendable contributions  binksternet is not numbered among them  in no way will i and many others link his name to veracity and credibility  his deny  deny  deny style reminiscent of certain members of the government is amusing if nothing else  unfortunately  this diatribe has impressed me with nothing of any value  this matter is settled and over and done with  and this is the last time i will edit on this subject on these pages  thank you to mark arsten for acting in a competent  intelligent and unbiased manner here  and my apologies to him for any potential problems my editing may have caused him regarding this subject  thank you  preceding unsigned comment added by talk just so you know i am nowhere near san diego  haven t been to the college ever and am not using an alias you quote a retired wiki editor who can no longer speak for himself  yet made edits to your article based on your inability to show credibility fuck off  ,0

  the mother carries her kittens  it should also point out that the behaviour links to mating as well  during mating the male bites the female on the back of the neck  and it is noticeable that many cats will adopt a  ready  posture  when not in heat or even male cats  when grasped by the scruff i ve added this  see cat skin think outside the box scientific classification it appears that the current use of f  silvestris catus as the main scientific name is the result of a somewhat misguided interpretation of developments in taxonomy  i propose it is changed back to f  catus  first  this is a continuation of a lot of past discussion  most recently archive species name  and  archive scientific name this discussion seems to have petered out into inactivity  it was noted that publications had started using silvestris catus  but no such citations were given  the article in its current state  under  scientific classification  cites iczn opinion however  as was noted in the prior discussion  this is a misinterpretation of the ruling  which was specifically aimed at wild animals and did not affect domestic animals  see this note  specifically reading from this erroneous nomenclature and the preceding paragraphs  itis was also cited in discussion  this clearly prefers catus as the conventional name  although it cites mws in noting that silvestris is also a synonym it would therefore be much more npov to acknowledge f  catus as the usual name  if catus and silvestris are indeed the same species then this should be discussed under  scientific classification  currently  this section should have disputed section scientific classification put on it  because its interpretation of the source is wrong  i would do this  but i m a new user  so semi protection is stopping me  it would be even better if somebody can provide a source explaining the equivalence  all the most cited  most reliable sources in this discussion so far have favoured f  catus also  while this is still semi protected  i d like to point out that both inline citations of mammal species of the world should be removed  the first is uncalled for by wp lead citations  the name cat is common knowledge and is recognised by all other references in the article body  the second deals with specific species names for cat breeds  msw doesn t even mention these names  so it s unfair to synthesise from that that wozencraft  let alone all feline biologists  does not support them  however  msw is a useful reference  so i suggest moving the citation to external links  or a probably needed further reading section  works for me  my opinion last time was that we should go with w hate ver the reliable sources say and f  catus is now the accepted name  then so be it  chat msw  is the canonical listing of mammalian taxonomy  it uses felis catus and notes there is some controversy  we should do the same talk i view this with suspicion  if  s interpretation is true  then itis should not report the domestic dog as canis lupus familiaris  and call canis familiaris invalid  the itis webpage has no entry at all for felis silvestris catus  not even to call it invalid  felis silvestris catus is used more and more frequently in the scientific literature  i draw this from scholar google com from uses of felis silvestris catus  many uses of felis silvestris f catus w hate ver that notation means  from http scholar google com scholar as q  num btng  search schol,0

it s interesting that this ip feels they know me so well  when i have had limited interaction with you we have never actively engaged each other on talk pages it s amazing you somehow have been able to edit every page i edit  every photograph you crop is mine have you wondered where this ire against me and my work has come from you continually put a photo of a man in a wig  a photoshopped wig  at that  on the afro page  and four different editors have removed it  five if you include me this is what you consider ownership and edit warring then you have taken my photographs and decided to rename them simply to remove david shankbone out of the file name your intentions are no pure you are gaming the policies and guidelines to wikistalk me you say not to bite the newcomers  but i haven t actively engaged you if you are a newcomer  how come you have such a handy knowledge of wiki policies and guidelines why is every page in your history one i have contributed to what is your issue with me  in particular you have also done all of this under another ip ,0
 rothbard himself relates that in the winter of in the course of a conversation with some left wing students  he realised that it was impossible for him to support the free market in all fields and at the same time be in favour of a state police force  my whole position was inconsistent there were only two logical possibilities  socialism  or anarchism  since it was out of the question for me to become a socialist  i found myself pushed by the irresistible logic of the case  a private property anarchist  or  as i would later dub it  an anarcho capitalist crocetta  roberta modugno  the anarcho capitalist political theory of murray n  rothbard in its historical and intellectual context  ,0

 rory delap firstly  welcome to wikipedia  as i say above  if you plan to stay please consider registering with regard to delap  i have a few comments  the period when he was on loan to stoke city in is kept separate in the infobox  thus  when comparing his stats in the infobox  the two appearances during the loan spell need to be discounted  generally when counting appearances  most users refer to an independent database such as soccerbase  rather than the club s website  which is often out of date  please do not use your edit summaries to attack other users  one of the tenets of wikipedia is to assume that the other user is acting under good faith  i e  his her edits were made after due consideration  thus comments like if this is causing you confusion and learn how to add which are mildly insulting  are not acceptable  best wishes  ,0

i am not sure if you are really understanding what i have been saying  we cannot put our own views or views of a leader of any party  or even base the party s ideology on them  i have been requesting you to read their manifestos from the very beginning  any party will not run on a single leader s views or any newspaper views  if you find the cpn m  and cpn uml  identically same or if you find one party s inclination towards socialism and or hardliner communism  in simple words  their political ideology and ultimately their position on the spectrum  same as the other in their manifestos  please let us all know  i will immediately withdraw my points  let us not debate here  any single person who has read both manifestos would be crystal clear on the ucpn m  and cpn uml  as far as what their position is  do not trust me but at least please go through their manifestos  also  i have been watching many parties wiki pages of several countries across continents and all of them have their position stated  why do you want to not keep it here  ithink it makes it more clear with their position on  the spectrum  thanks ,0
major revision i suggest a major revision of this article i would like to see the bnp itself given the same article format as other ploitical parties but to also include the less pleasant information that would be useful to anyone wanting to know waht they are all about at the moment  everything is mixed together and it just comes across as chaotic it does noone any favours the bnp or their opponents history of the bnp sections policies and position section this section could actually do with some padding  electoral achievements section affiliated parties sections opposition to the bnp sections to include elements of section bnp uncovered sections ,0

 hey there  i saw your recent comment on the yom kippur war talk page here and i too share your concern and frustration over the endless reverts by the pov pushers such as this one by romac  i have had issues with him in the past in connection with other articles  i have yet to see him add relevant content or make one productive edit  i have only observed him engage in endless reverts of sourced material  in any event  we need to build consensus  currently  you and i as well as and favor israeli military victory in the infobox  sherif  johnz and romac oppose  the rest seem to be on the sidelines though i believe that and seem to be leaning on our side  in fact  hohum actually reverted sherif here and restored my sourced edit concerning idf victory  i think that it is imperative that all edits be sourced  it is also imperative to effectuate substantive edits within the article itself so that the changes reflect and correlate to the result section of the infobox  in any event  don t dispair and don t give up  you ve made some excellent edits thus far  i encourage you to continue  best regards  ,0
  and get used to working with people of different views rather than against them  like we all have to learn this at present the science section doesn t seem under real threat  if it does get threatened there will be a storm for sure as it s gently understated at present  and the issues and phrasing in that section have gone through a long and tortured time  so any change there is sure to reopen wounds  i ll take a closer look when i get back ,0

  yes and no  for example  if reliable source a calls incident x state terror and uses argument y to prove it then a separate reliable source b that supports argument y might be used  even if it doesn t directly speak of state terror likewise  if reliable source c criticizes argument y  again with no mention of state terror they we can also use it  also  even when there is no controversy per se  you might want to use sources that provide supporting information  such as proving the existence of organizations or laws  your perspective  i am afraid is a narrow one in other words  while the narrative should be around precisely source who do explicitly use the term  there are many instances where sources can  and probably need to  be used that do not explore the concept itself  lastly  even when the phrase state terror is not used  but the article is clearly about the topic  it might be included  rather than a blanket prohibition in the abstract  we should have a discussion on inclusion in the concrete for each instance  ,0

 when one tries to find the several books and numerous articles apart from his work on suicide not much if anything shows up  yes  he is called a professor associate on that webpage  but he never was a  full  professor and he actually currently is a school teacher  and he is clearly not credible  simply because he publicly decried a book he hadn t read  inventing imaginary faults in it and failing to make a single valid point of criticism  he furthermore used words on the author of the book he hadn t read which were and are regarded as libelous by many  that is not the behaivor of a credible person  let alone a respectable  credible academic  ,0
 my two cents political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it  this is sad that political correctness has come to this level  it is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior  this is sad  we might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech  this is next  truly sad  truly sad  indeed  also  regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as  china is the reason why the us s economy is in the crapper  and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early s  we have made those people rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling  open your eyes and for those reasons  i despise china as well as the politically correct nigger  rdly  it is apparent by reading wiki s page on the controversial word  nigger  rdly that stupid people and words do not mix  it has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school  proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition  that persons are asking that it be banned from the english language  as i said idiot  s and words can be a dangerous combination what is even sadder is that i expressed this comment on wiki s  nigger  rdly page  and was accused of vandalism  yet others posted similar comments  i must of hit a nerve with some idiot  s who don t have a large understanding of the english language and it proper usage  lol  ,1

 w hate ver you do  do not leave me a message est april i keep finding pages that have been deleted i just added a  unreferenced  tag to a wiki deletion policy page i m sure i m not the first person to think of this what degree of crap will be flung can only be imagined  i undid your edit to ignore all rules  as it was not in the spirit of wikipedia see wikipedia do not disrupt wikipedia to illustrate a point that should be wikipedia what ignore all rules means please sign your entries by typing four tildes  have you read wikipedia please do not bite the newcomers yet except when you violate the rules about creating articles you said  except when you violate the rules about creating articles  in which case the page in violation will be quickly deleted  leaving no trace of what occurred  even the conversation about it may be deleted forever  this comment  like everything else on this page  does not cite sources  this comment may also be in violation of some rule that s an interesting point  several people are starting to look into issues with the deletion system already  will you be helping out with that hi kim i don t know what looking into even means  in regards to wikipedia  i don t know who people are  who does what  or who created the rules i don t know what helping out means  in regards to your question my first effort here  at creating an entry  was put up for deletion in minutes  then deleted without discussion by some admin now i can t find the brief discussion about that  but it led to the realization that many many pages here  the ones that state policy and rules for wikipedia  don t cite sources the pages don t list authors either they are nebulous pages  that don t follow the rules those pages insist i follow interesting damn right it is interesting i ve read a lot of criticism of wiki  and defended wikipedia for years but now  well  i see a huge flaw in the system  reply the only links i saw in the article  the one on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  seemed to work fine now  were there other ones you were thinking of i answered on your talk page  cornfused i tell you  heh heh is user nakon some kind of bot i have no idea what happens on wikipedia sometimes while reading the als entry  due to a friend having been diagnosed with it  i followed a link to the als association  which gave me that page that says there is no article i looked it up on google  and created a short starter page on it  right after i hit create  i realized there was already an entry  but it was under als association  so i hit edit this page  to make it a redirect  it came up as deleted in a matter of seconds  some ass hole  called nakon had deleted the page  deletion log nakon deleted the als association csd a corp article about a company that doesn t assert significance considering there already was a page  and it certainly is significant  the ultrafast deletion is an example of some kind of fuck  ed up mentality this idiot has to be using some kind of software to scan every new article  and s he must have spent seconds before hitting some sort of deletion key unbelievable this level of bull shit  goes beyond anything i have ever encountered on the internet before if i had changed the entry to a redirect  i would have missed the event i use wikipedia all the time  but i spend almost no time editing or creating pages most of the changes i have made over the years have been fixing minor mistakes or reverting vandalism having managed to avoid ever being drawn into the,0

i strongly disagree whith your opinion  but since i m clearly outnumbered i ll accept your decision  in my opinion  the most information it s removed  the least useful this article becomes  the only opening year isn t really relevant  if it s taken individually and despite being stable data  they re alike questionable  at least for early systems and this way even the sortability of the table becomes pointless  it ll be more rational to revert the article to a mere  simple list as it was before march if i correctly saw in the history conversely  the reader s usefulness of collecting statistic data in such a global list is far bigger than adding that to a nationwide continental list  if you re interested in some specific system you can go directly to their individial wiki pages  while if you aim to a world overview  it s somewhat tiring to search  open match a handful of different article  don t take it to heart  but i don t intend to further contribute to this list  good luck with your project  but from my personal point of view as reader user it doesn t worth the needed time and effort ,0

 your talent at invoking personal attack seems to exceed your talent at replying intelligently to any of my points if you can t take the heat  you shouldn t be editing an encyclopedia it s pretty clear that wikipedia s personal attack policy is simply a ploy to ban people with whom the administrators disagree  and prevent them from making contributions to wikipedia  while at the same time preserving the illusion of some level playing field for intellectual discourse  to illustrate this point  we need look no further than the items removed by jimbo from the justin berry talk page  citing personal attack which included every mention of the term camwhore  which is itself a wikipedia topic  and the following paragraph please feel free to try and figure out who is the victim of the personal attack here  i m dissapointed that the majority of this page was deleted  most likely because one of the editors is a self admitted pedophile  is it fair to declare that a pedophile can t be neutral on a page that involves pedophilia i guarantee that wikipedia wouldn t ban a jew  from editing a page on the holocaust  or ban a black person from editing a page on affirmative action  a pedophile is just as capable of editing with a neutral pov on a subject matter dealing with pedophilia  as a jew  or a black would be on an issue that involves jew s or blacks  wikipedia claims to be a online encyclopedia that anyone can edit  if that doesn t include pedophiles  than how is that fair if we allow certain  sex  minorities to be silenced  what s next allowing certain racial minorities to be silenced as well  as a frequent reader and occasional editor of wikipedia  i only want to read factual  neutral pov articles  and i don t care about the race  nationality  ethnicity  sex  or  sex  orientation of the editor  even if most people have moral objections to pedophilia  surely we can agree that we all have a right to post on wikipedia as long as we abide by the rules  tab you people talk a good game  but what you say and what you do are two entirely different things ,0

 i have closed that mfd as delete  that being the overall sense of the debate  but would you object to the page being userfied to piotrus  as several contributors suggested i would not object to this  go right ahead  done  thanks  arbcom elections ciao  barts a  i noticed you ve made steps towards standing as a candidate in this year s arbcom elections  unfortunately  it does not look as if you meet the eligibilty criteria of having made mainspace edits before november so you will not be able to submit a candidacy  please correct me if i am wrong regards  skomorokh  i intend to run as this shows i have over edits  more than qualifying me to stand for the position and at any rate this election needs all the candidates it can get  that link indicates you have mainspace edits  not and some of those have been made since nov  st  th sorry  skomorokh  either way i intend to run anyway  and if you look at the guideline for edits you will see that it actually says november not november my mistake  it is november as you say  however  you still do not meet the threshold for article space edits and so are prohibited from running  sincerely  skomorokh  you seem to have a rather strong position on this  my error regarding the date aside  it s pretty black and white  sincerely  skomorokh  i have withdrawn my self nomination  but i believe that the lack of nominees this time around is due to unfriendly messages such as above  i hope that i will have enough edits next time around to qualify  i apologise if you found my messages unfriendly  that was very much not my intention  you have the misfortune of being the first ineligible candidate this year  so i do not think this can be attributed as the reason for the lack of nominations  best  skomorokh  commentbarts a  the requirement is for mainspace edits  not total edits you don t appear to meet the requirement  no wonder candidates are so few and far between  there are many thousands of wikipedians who easily exceed those requirements  and while i don t know if the minimum requirements are the same as last year  i suspect that all the successful and most of the unsuccessful candidates in previous years had rather more than a thousand mainspace edits  any explanation for the paucity of candidates would need to explain why fewer of the qualified candidates are standing  spielchequers too much paperwork  mostly one editor s fault  and a week filled with people saying nasty things about you for most of us  rfa was enough  and i leaned my lesson last year  barts a  i m not sure why you ve requested comment on this  it is a black and white standard  i don t know the reason behind it  but i would guess it is to ensure that only wikipedia contributors that have a certain level of experience and dedication to the project are allowed to run in the arbcom elections  of course  counting,0

since you are an anonymous ip with no edits other than the one on my talk page  i doubt you will come back to read my response  nevertheless i do not fully understand the reasoning behind your complaint  you are implying that i maliciously removed links to club websites  in order to sever contact between clubs and their members  this is not the case  i removed them because they are nothing more than advertising  if we were to include links to two clubs  then it would be logical that we should link to all of them  i am simply following guidelines specified in what wikipedia is not  wikipedia is not a place to promote things  regardless of whether the thing being promoted is a charitable club  a political party or a product  wikipedia is also not a search engine  in that people looking to join a particular lifesaving club  or find its website  would be better advised to use google or another search engine therefore  i feel that my removal of the links was in keeping with the guidelines of wikipedia  if you or someone else feels that they should be there for one reason or another  then you have every right to put them back  and i will not go out of my way to take them out again  if you have a genuine reason why they should be included in the article ,0
 clarify issued i ve added a clarify tag to the word issued in the first paragraph  this is easily the most confusing and non obvious aspects of carbon trading how does a government decide how many credits ought to be issued  for free  i assume  to each entity before trading begins indeed  most questions about emissions trading boil down to this very question for example  if an auction is used  and the auction is efficient  economics would predict that no trades would take place post auction  the occurrence of such trades would imply that the auction had been improper making the whole concept of cap and trade actually mean cap via auction i don t mean any of this as criticism but  as wikipedia is an encyclopedia  i think it s failing to fulfill it s job here by dodging the most policy critical aspect of the issue i think simply writing issue does the reader an injustice  ,0

 i get what you re saying  and i was more than happy with him in the legends section but when they include him in the open  they re putting forth that he s looked at as a member of the roster and a part of the show basically they re saying hey look  rock s a raw guy  and techincally  he s the number contender to the wwe title  since john cena is the champion  i know  there s no guarantee cena s the champ at mania  but as of now  rocky s got a championship match on a ppv  thus he should be part of the roster for that alone but mainly  since he s featured in the open  that shows that wwe is pushing him as part of raw and if days passes w o a rock sighting  then he gets reactivated when he comes back  ,0

proposed deletion i created this article because robyn e  kenealy is a notable member of the new zealand comics community  i agree  a lot of the subsequent edits since my original ones are puffery  and look like they are by the same anonymous person  the article i wrote was fairly minimal in detail  see robyn e  kenealy oldid but my original edits were well sourced  i am particularly concerned that cameron scott does  not recognise new zealand comics comics org nz as an authoritative source because it is an open source wiki  this website is the authoritative resource for information about new zealand comics  while individual contributors can add their information to this wiki  content is stringently moderated by funtime comics s sysops darren schroeder  ruth boyask and isaac freeman  the website has also won awards for its content  this is an important issue because if you set the precendent in this article of saying comics org nz website is not authoritative you are undermining comics culture in new zealand ,0

  as i said  initially when i began to look into this i thought that ihts might have violated the iban by visiting a page that maxbrowne had edited  i went back to check whether the iban might restrict editors from editing the same page  some ibans do have such a provision  but i saw there was no such provision  furthermore  ihts was pretty good about not addressing maxbrowne either directly or indirectly on that page  that s why my follow up comment was to declare that there was no violation and that i felt that ihts didn t go there just because of maxbrowne  and did so only because of his interest in chess matters  and if i d concluded there was stalking i would definitely have noted that both at ani and on ihts s user talk page  look again at my comment at ani where i told maxbrowne so i thought i made it clear that this wasn t a stalking incident  again  i thought ihts was only there because he edits chess articles and areas related to chess and there was no iban violation  he did a very good job of restraining himself from commenting to or about maxbrowne on that page  ,0

  now that i m thinking about it  another frequently expressed criticism is that steam is a drm tool  a combination of the following three sources should be reliable enough indicare published an article about it but although there are mostly massive complaints about valve s rigid usage control system it is alarming to see how little consumers have reacted to this practice and that it has not negatively affected sales of the game richard stallman  mentioned as a notable drm critic at digital rights management opposition to drm  called drm d steam for linux games unethical defective by design says steam s drm violates users  freedom ,0

 someone keeps erasing this with no comment to me very unethical  minutes after posting this it was erased  check it out  this is very suspicious and unethical by the parties involved  senior management  if in existence  asked to investigate please do not block me for trying to improve the integrity of the article  hello  my name is johnhistory  i was recently  block  for my mentioning of major problems here because i did not assume good faith when confronted with bad faith  i believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the jimbo guidelines to the t  i am going to post what i wrote on my talk page after being  block  during the controversy here  i could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the wiki elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny  this surely does not make me popular amongst them  yet i must assume good faith in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process  i was accused of supporting things i never did  all i ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents  that is all  i don t especially care about rev wright  etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then i will stick my neck out for it  i have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased  that is what struck me about the discussion page mind you i never made an edit on the actual article i was banned for merely talking on a talk page  it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group  think environment  thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public controlled by a small group of ideologues wikipedia  these political minding ideologues are dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions  these  not just mine  are non threatening non  offensive language just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be  block  and potentially banned for not assuming good faith or positively contributing to the consensus what if the consensus is wrong then  what if about if you have already assumed good faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it  the evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing obama with w bush  additionally  the obama administration through proxies  in my strong opinion  is at work in the obama article  i say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion  as is understandable  that someone out of the thousands of obama connected likely people is not involved on the barack obama page  it is the most visited page on wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name barack obama  however  that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes  the number of those is in the millions  that is why jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a real encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work  the language given the rulers of wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with  often the language is contradictory  for instance i was  block  for my comments on the talk page and cited for making a point instead of wanting to edit how  exactly  do you make a talk page based discussion about edits without making a point  another monitor told me i had to assume good faith  yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article  in addition  the talk page says no writing will be allowed that involves general discussion however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts  additionally  the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or potentially scandalous to the president of the united stat,0
i know you know i didn t make that attack  but i am apologizing nonetheless  obviously vandalism is to be expeced  but that does not mean it should be apologized or overlooked  especially in the case of a personal attack  so  i offer my apologies that you were treated in such a manner  and that there are editors on this wiki who would behave in such a manner  i suppose that s what us editors are here for  we make wikipedia a better place  parlez moi  ici pour humor,0
