 yes they are garish  though per wp redlinks they can encourage people to make new articles and help expand wiki  the only problem is that a lot of sis have names that don t match area names in reality  so it s tricky to find matching articles in many cases  a bit of local knowledge helps in that respect  to link colloquially named articles to formal names used by the government  up to you if you want to retain or remove them  there is no strict policy as to their use  only not to intentionally red link trivial things not notable enough to ever need an article  chat rff ,0
 alright  did it ,0
 ai thanks for the message on my talk page no harm done  as i was offline of wp briefly at the time myself  and i learned a lot in the process of restoring and improving the article to wp notability standards  a lesson i ve applied elsewhere i also learned more about the wp distinction between primary and secondary sources the result is all to the good  i ll take your word that the oldprodfull  template is a good thing  though i think on first sight that the template s terse wording this article was proposed for deletion by an editor in the past could be clearer as to its intent  does this really suffice to  in your words  let future editors know that the article has already been through the proposed deletion process once and is no longer eligible for deletion without a proper discussion or other reason i hope so  though it was not obvious to me  it reads more like an invitation to agree or disagree to deletion and so reprise the issue if you can see it that way  as a relatively novice editor might  perhaps the oldprodfull template could be expanded to that effect  with some procedural directives and relevant links  to the original prod and the policy guidelines for continuance i defer to your experience and good judgment  btw  since you liked kurzweil s other book  the singularity is near is certainly worth a skim  moore s law on steroids  a fascinating perspective  from ai s greatest optimist  thanks again  atama  and welcome back  ,0
  please read unblock request carefully  this why i ask whoever read my request to read it carefully i will address your points in order of when your address them first  your said that you will work with the editor to help make the page notable  yet that is what i was asking for throughout the entire debate before i was  block for someone to help me make the page notable  i cannot help showing i was annoyed when everyone who posted on that debate was making negative comments and continued to push for it to be deleted  seen as i was the person making all the editing  it is the responsibility for administrators to assist me making all pages in question notable  i had already said sorry for the choice of words i ve made throughout the debate but again it is as if no one has the desire to care whether a user is remorseful of his action so long as the debate can continue  with or without them  second  if the only party that was trying to defend the case was  block  and prevent not only from actively defending the pages in question  but stopped from actually adding the references and making the page more notable  well i m sorry but i was doing my best all things considering  even before i was  block  from wikipedia  i did add in more reference  i read some of the notability guild lines and did make some changes  however i am only one person and there is so much i could do before i can say i done my fair share  can someone help me finish this but clearly not  i really don t know wikipedia as well as you and other administrators do  but considering i have made many pages and edited many more in the short time i have started using wikipedia properly  i can say that i have made useful information for people to read about and get accurate accounts of this  my point with this is that even though i have made massive contributions on here  there are things i do not know  and how to get pages back on wikipedia after they are deleted is one of them  so if you kindly give me details and links on how to do this would be most appreciated i still fail to see why it is disrupted behaviour to return pages back on wikipedia the way i have  a page before on ryan shamrock  fighter  was speedily deleted and then returned back on here  but not by me  and up until just today  no one has affected that  the user who is suggesting it has also recommended other pages for deletion  however  the user clearly doesn t know the fighters he wants deleted  as of them are have competed in either a major mma promotion or a second tier promotion  as he is doing such pointless acts  i still wonder why he s able to do this knowing he will get into trouble with other admins for the similar things i ve done  here is the link for this debate wikipedia articles for deletion ryan shamrock  fighter i get what you do mean when you say that it isn t about shark fights or ring of combat when it comes to this debate now  but none the less it is still an issue not to be ignored  ucmma cage rage uk was deleted for the same reasons that those two promotions  as well as a few other promotions on wp mmanot  should be  i find it amazing how these promotions are actually accepted by certain admins and are allowed to remain on there whilst a promotion i ve been helping with  that has a better laid out page than the others and was making the improvements the other users were screaming on about doing for it  yet it got deleted  whilst those others ones get treated like they are highly ranked promotions  ucmma cage rage uk has a weekly chat show on sky sports whilst showing their delayed timed events on sky sports i bet those other promotions don t even get tv time the head of cage rage uk never asked me to post those articles  i have always worked by myself to help them with their wikipedia page  never even expecting a thank you because i like their product and want to help other find reliable sources on them  which as many knows  wikipedia is the place for that  if you type in ucmma in the facebook search bar  find the one with a picture of the words  cage  on the top rage  in the middle  and  uk com  at the bottom  then like their page  then keep looking for any posts from carl gale  as i keep mentioning to look on wikipedia for ucmma cage rage uk information  fights at certain events etc  look as far back as the  st september you will clearly see that not only was ucmma not part of it  they were pretty much telling me that all their information can be found on their website and their facebook account so there was no need to continue doing it  however  i kept working on the wikipedia pages  making contributions whenever possible leading up until their ucmma hands of war event  once a few days went by after the event  the head of media for cage rage uk started to post wall messa,0

 ok  please feel free to describe how the following is a personal attack  if you can support that accusation it seems that many users have had problems with  harassment and vandalism why do you continually harass other users and then falsly accuse them of vandalism or other wiki infringements  please  do not delete this comment  i am only here as a mediator and this is not a personal attack  only a simple question as to what motivates you to defame other users here are the examples that i have compiled since being introduced to this issue  we have  who complains about your harassment on this talk page above  i have not attacked you  actually  quite the reverse  i have not exercized censorship  quite the reverse  what s it called when you accuse others of being something that you actually are describes your actions as rootless accusations of vandalism in response to my recent edit of the wikipedia article police state don t even pass the straight face test  even took the time to write a letter to the administrators about your behavior dear administrators i would like to file a complaint against user nescio for wanton vandalism of the article entitled police state user nescio has been deleting sections of the article he or she personally disagrees with e g  historical police state examples chile under the dictatorship of augusto pinochet and argentina under the proceso de reorganizaci  n nacional as well as other examples this childish and irrational behaviour has resulted in a blatant misrepresentation of the facts  which is detrimental to wikipedia s credibility and accuracy  i have tried to reason with this user  but it is unfortunately to no avail regretfully i have no choice but to request that this user be  block  from editing at this time  sincerely yours user winston smith describes you as the worst editor i have ever encountered on wikipedia while encouraging you to please stop this childish behavior  had his warnings to you about harassment deleted and reported you as a vandal has repeatedly reverted to prior revisions of the police state article after being instructed to view the discussion page  i then placed a warning on  talk page  which he promptly removed  he continues to remove the warnings has requested sources for the addition  at least five have been provided  yet  refuses to acknowledge their existence and insists on trying to incite an edit war  is continuing to remove edits and warnings of mine from his talk page  while falsely accusing me of stalking  and sock puppetry  it seems that you harass anyone who attempts to edit the police state article without your viewpoint  this is against wp npov policy  please stop harassing users otherwise more effective measures will have to be undertaken  as expected  you removed this comment for discussion in violation of wikipedia s vandalism rules  please do not remove this again  ,0

hello ollech  in regards to your questions  no i am not the same person who made hispanic australian  and before you mentioned this article i wasn t even aware of it s existence  this also striked me as odd as you have been actively making contributions to that article for a while now  but as you seem to be a new member you may not know all the little helpful features of wikipedia  by checking the history of a page you can see who created it and can verify i wasn t the user who created this page  also from the follow up questions you have asked it seems to me you have an issue with the use of the word latino  all these questions i will try to answer for you spaniards and italians are not latinos because they are european and not from latin america i can t give you the exact reference  as i no longer have access to it i m not exactly sure what you mean by this so i will leave it unanswered in regards to a link there is actually a site called latinoaustralia no  there is absolutely no reference of him being latino or identifying as latino  and i don t think anyone will ever find one judging from what was said in that article  the reason he was added is because he is from chile  but on further revision he could be easily removed from this page ,0
as i said  they need to be sourced ,0
hi arejay i think the edit by kaysov was to list the names of states and languages in an alphabetical order and thereby not giving any biased preferences to any states or languages to be listed first  eg  tamil nadu that is first on the list of states in the article  would be last because andhra pradesh begins with a and tamil nadu with t  if that is the purpose then i think we need to stick to it sep utc ,0

 shiny toy  guns i ve been trying to add shiny toy guns onto the list for quite some time and every time i add them it is deleted there is no doubt that stg are alternative  just about every music source there is classifies them as indie alternative i m going to keep putting them on the list no matter how many times it gets deleted until someone can provide me with a good explanation as to why they don t belong on it  preceding unsigned comment added by their wiki page lists them as indie electronica and their official site describes them as electronica indie rock indie and alternative are not the same thing  and electronica while not actually a real genre is also not alternative  you also tend to add them in with a flurry of other non alternative mainstream crap pop rock that don t belong on the list  like paramore and fall out boy  they stay off  stop adding them  okay but fyi i never added paramore or fall out boy  ,0

canola oil is rapeseed oil  but rapeseed oil isn t necessary canola oil  they developed a cultivar of rape  i think it was in the s  that has low ecruic acid levels  and once they got the us to approve the new name  canola is canadian oil it only took about years before farmers were growing large quantities  i can t see women buying rape oil  even if they know better  it sounds like an antisocial alternative to ky jelly  if i recall correctly  regular rape oil is a drying oil  mostly used industrially  perhaps in some specialty paints  it s toxic  but i don t know  how  toxic a lot of the foods we eat are toxic  salt is a necessity  but a cup of salt would be lethal to half of all adults who ingest it  thanks from me  too not much time on my hands these days  but when i see something that is wrong  i have a hard time leaving it alone  not a desirable character trait  i ll have you know  they say dentists and computer programmers have a high suicide rate  but i suspect copyeditors  proofreaders  and fact checkers probably have a high rate of getting murdered  god knows the sobs deserve it i see that you ve been busy  and you can take the fact that you don t see my edits very often as a high compliment  ,0
 citation quality first thing  i kiss the  virtual  feet of wikidemon thanks so very much for the wonderful cleanup of references yesterday second thing  it seems like despite the heroic efforts  citations keep getting new problems with new edits wb inserted a bunch of footnotes to support the claim that charges or convictions of acorn workers have occurred unfortunately  these facts seem firstly motivated by wp truth  and only secondarily by citations nonetheless  i think something close to this number is probably right  and i have nothing against it being in the article  fwiw  it was me who edited a few days ago to say at least i actually think the  at least  is clarifying  but i m not going to fight about those two words at some length on this talk page  wb provided lots of citations  most of them from far right opinion publications rather than reliable sources in an edit today to the article  a somewhat different set of citations were provided these seem rather sloppily collected the first one i looked at was the wonderfully wp rs nyt  however  once i read its body  i saw that it had nothing relevant to the claim given in the sentence  it was about ken blackwell s stricter enforcement of registration requirements in perhaps in excess of the new laws according to the article it was an interesting article  just not one having anything to do with the sentence it was listed next to so i ll look through the rest of the added citations i urge other editors to also pay careful attention to the relevance and accuracy of citations added by a certain set of highly partisan editors there s wheat among the chaff  but we obviously can t assume that just because something points to  e g  nyt it actually supports the point claimed  talk  ,0

  the phrase large number seems at best exaggerated  especially as a  the given source does not cite a number of bosnian and or muslim participants at all  describing them and their activities only in vague ominous terms  and b  the source  icon of evil hitler  s mufti and the rise of radical islam  isbn appears almost egregiously slanted and unworthy for use on wikipedia  i think it may be valid to include information about bosnian volunteers and their mobilization by this particular mufti  but it needs to be sourced from elsewhere and worded more carefully  having studied the einsatzgruppen  especially einsatzgruppe d  more than the average self educator could begin to consider enduring  and having never before seen this source or this information more of an accusation really i find the tone of the whole assertion and citation highly problematic  ,0

 request for arbitrage by non greek people  i request arbitrage for the following  more then once greek nationalistic editors removed my contributions i want non greek people to look into this  it can t be that wikipedia turns into a greek extremistic and nationalistic propaganda forum i bought an atlas in witch you can see that the cham area belonged to albania nom  robbe  m  g  ographie de m  robbe  m  thode pour apprendre facilement la g  ographie  divis  e en deux tomes tome premier contenant un abbr  g de la sph  re  la division de la terre  the article below describes how the cham were expelled by the greek  napoleon zervas zervas was forced to resign in when details of his contacts with the german occupation authorities surfaced this quote came from wikepedia s biography of napoleon zervas  other sites are more explicit and call him a  nazi  collaborateur  nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the  nazi  s  however it was zervas thet collaborated with the  nazi  s that expelled them  shouldn t this be more explicit in this article  there is a un resolution which asks the greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties the rest of this article is lame  i miss the following copyright illyrians org  during the conference of ambassadors in london in the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the greek state despite the fact that people of the southern epirus were albanians of orthodox and the muslim faith  while the orthodox albanians were targets of hellenization  the muslim albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the greek government chams who lived in southern epirus  chameria or thesprotia as it is called by the greeks  were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in europe at the end of the second world war  the cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the european continent  statistical yearbook of the greek government in showed that chams lived in chameria region in greece at that time as a result of the ethnic cleansing and genocide albanian muslims were violently expelled from the chameria region  and sought refuge in the republic of albania  where they still live  today  there are members of this population in albania  a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population  on the other hand  current number of cham albanians living in greece is estimated at around yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in greece  to cite but one example  they can speak albanian only in their homes the population of chameria has always been ethnically albanian a lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that chameria had been populated by albanians  even the greek historian herodotus underscored this fact in his book historias and called albanians of the chameria barbarians  a term used by the ancient greeks to distinguish non greek people the census held by the turkish administration in established that there were orthodox and muslim albanians in the region  the demographic map of the british military mission sent to the british government in london indicates that on the eve of the second world war of chameria s population was albanian the pro greek historian spiro muselimi  in his book historical sight through thesprotia edited in joannina on wrote that the bishop of thesprotia in the year trans lated some parts of bible into albanian  as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in greek the greek authorities  sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on greek territory  have followed a well established chauvinistic policy and  as history recorded  they committed genocide against the albanians of muslim faith  the racial assault on chameria s muslim albanians began to be first applied at the end of the second world war  in when criminal bands of the notorious general napoleon zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them on june greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region  the terror committed against this population was beyond description  it included killings  rapes  inhuman treatment  massacre of women  babies and pregnant women  more than men  women and children were killed within hours in the town of paramithy  on tuesday  june which happened to be the date of st bartholomeus day for the whole chameria during the june march period persons were killed in filat people were killed,0

 you will do just fine  and shabaz was made to retire as far as my personal opinion is concerned his is by far the dirtiest dysysop i have witnessed ever however dougweller is quite an expert so his input will be valuable  now to matter at hand  the current version of the article has three basic problems which i will list below  we can discuss them together or separately as you wish code apparently agrees with my other edits  even though he does not wish to state it  i would also like to state that  is quite right  i misunderstood prophetic as being concerned with prophecy at first but i am certain now that it means pertaining to the prophet it has been proven here that israr khan is just a non notable run of the mill professor at some malaysian university who writes self published books  consensus has already been reached between me and code that he is an unreliable source for content  as is clear from the discussion i linked  so i would like to contest his views being added here  or anywhere else for that matter  hallaq has been given a new section all by himself without any rationale  he is a western scholar so he should be included with other western scholars and given due weight  to be frank his weight should be less than other western scholars  as he is not a scholar of hadith per se  he is a scholar of law jurisprudence  and as law is based on hadith he is also knowledgeable in hadith  but he cannot compare with other scholars whose main interest was hadith  i would like to contest the creation of authenticity subsection  my  argument is that this section is highly misleading  it leads one to assume that other scholars are against hadith for other reason  whereas in reality almost all scholars both western and eastern  criticize hadith because they consider it as inauthentic so this section should not be created at all  regards ,0

 globabilization is not designed second sentence mentions the goal of globabilization  the process behind it is much more complex than someone stating that it will increase material wealth  goods  and services and enacting appropriate policies  typically  the reason companies would rely on foreign inputs sales is for price profit reasons which may result in increases in material wealth  but that is certainly not their goal  increased efficiencies are the side effect of self interest on a global scale  think invisible hand ,0

oh dear rick  we are back your misunderstanding of what probability means i am not sure if we are allowed to discus this any more  perhaps it is ok on this page richard confirms above that there are two interpretations of probability  bayesian and frequentist although they both should give the same answer to any exact question it is very confusing to flip interpretation in the middle of an argument i am happy to discuss the mhp using either model but let us start with the bayesian perspective first to a bayesian  probability is a state of knowledge that is the definition of what bayesian probability means in the bayesian model  what is not known does not exist that is not something  that i have just made up  i am sure richard will confirm it or you can confirm it using wp or any good text book so  if the player does not know where the car is placed  or the host s door opening strategy  the probability of winning by switching is exactly it may be that the car is always placed behind door and the host always opens door but  if we do not know that  it makes no difference to our  bayesian  probability calculation  which depends by definition only on the information that we have the concept of average probability makes no sense  there is just  the probability  which is based only on our state of knowledge ,0

the text of the article could have been taken from tudjman era croatian propaganda press  the consequence is that we either have to question its impartiality  or revalue the widely accepted view of croatian wartime propaganda being nationalistic and biased  some crucial pieces of information are obviously missing  particularly the plight of the city s inhabitants of serbian nationality about half of the total number in the city subject to croatian military rule  or the very existence thereof  parts of the text are clearly self contradictory  the croatian forces are claimed to be lightly armed  yet they still manage to down warplanes  and full of dubious propaganda cliches  the backbone of jna was broken at vukovar one does not need to be an expert on war in the balkans to note these shortcomings  naturally  this does not mean that we should subscribe to the serbian propaganda of the time an effort should be taken to compile a realistic picture from icty proceedings  from well known western reporters present at or near the scene  misha glenny and from other sources  actually  merely citing these sources will do a better service to the reader than this  numbers  we need sources and references for the numbers ,0

correctionperson  you keep removing my edits because you claim they have no references  however the original content in which i replaced also has no references attributed to them  as i said before  if you really want someone to references their content then simply use the feature that requests for a references i know it exists i have seen it before  instead of completely removing my content  and since you are removing my content and reverting it with the original content that i replaced which is also not at all references yes i absolutely believe you constant amending to my content is vanadlism in nature as well as unruly  as i would like to reenforce  request references for my content  instead of vandalizing it and completely deleting it  i am again  going to change it back to the way i had it as that information is more up to date and more descriptive of the nature of the christian identity belief  my content that i am posting does include hyper links in them and it is valid and purely documentorial and unbiased in nature  there is no reason for you to be removing it  i would like to further state a third time simply request a reference for my content instead of completely deleting it  my content is a wealth of information and knowledge and it is a shame you keep removing it,0

 response to anonymous to repeat once again it appears your sole purpose as an editor on wikipedia is to remove criticisms of atf  which may be considered vandalism  it s difficult to consider you a serious editor when you continually hide behind different anonymous ip addresses as stated previously by other editors  if you want to be considered a legitimate editor  register a name and sign your posts otherwise  you may be considered only a disruptive vandal  i ve given consideration to your diatribe and find your arguments specious obviously  you have an intense personal interest in extolling the virtues of atf  and your threat to bury the criticism  is totally inappropriate nevertheless  i ve personally reviewed the section in question  and found it to be a bit cluttered with too many incidents of atf individual corruption which dilutes the impact therefore  at this time  i won t revert your removal  atf has many good agents and employees  and it does much good work however  the  attaboy  side of the ledger seems now to be overwhelmed by the  aw shit side fast and furious being a prime example  ,0

 further edits have persisted adding citation needed tags to the lede since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article  which should be sourced wp citelead does require editors to add redundant citations i e  if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead  the first two sections of the article detail  trans cripts  in which  hitler  proclaims himself to be vegetarian diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from onwards  sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent  indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life  instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so  if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it  please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence  it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes  tags only alert editors to a potential problem  but if we do not understand what the problem is we cannot address it  ,0

reply  i added another  different  quotation from the same article that helps firm up how russell felt on the subject  i  believe this added material compliments rather than hinders the presentation  it makes it more conclusive  reply  i added another  different  quotation from the same article that helps firm up how russell felt on the subject  i  believe this added material compliments rather than hinders the presentation  it makes it more conclusive  my statement that russell never suggested organized prohibition on using blood represents the conclusion of a modus tollens argument  however  rather than speculating about what russell did or did not suggest  my statement should have read that russell never organized a prohibition on using blood among his fellow worshippers  modus tollens would have us accept that had russell  as president of the watchtower organization  organized a prohibition on using blood among his followers then we would have seen organized prohibition on using blood among his followers  since there is no record of such an organized prohibition among russell s fellow worshippers then the modus tollens argument form has us conclude that russell never organized it  the underlying premises of this particular argument are that russell applied his presidency and that his fellow worshippers acted on his presidential initiatives  there is ample evidence that russell applied his presidency  and that his fellows acted on it  hence  it is not my opinion that russell never organized a prohibition on using blood among his fellow worshippers  rather  it is a logical end to a valid argument form based on evidenced premises  for the time being i have removed the statement about russell and organized prohibition on blood under his presidency  if you dispute the validity of what i write above then please offer logical refutation  keeping in mind that logical constructions and conclusions are not at the mercy of preferential outcomes  i e private opinion i make the latter comment only to demonstrate my commitment to logical conclusions is above my commitment to any personal opinions i may presently hold  if you fail to offer refutation within a reasonable time then i will return my comment to the history section  but in a more precise form ,0

 hi  witaku and welcome to wikipedia  i was not the one who deleted the article you created  i tagged it for deletion because it lacked notability  and it was subsequently deleted by an administrator after review  a google search for nyrva dragonrhyne produces only hits  that is hardly a lot  two of the hits are deleted wiki pages and the other are from self published websites  facebook and deviantart  neither of which is a proper reference source  i think if you wish to write articles about fictional characters  it would be a good idea to review some of the wikipedia guidelines for notability  such as wikipedia notability  fiction  elements of fiction  and check out some of the articles about notable anime manga characters already included in wikipedia  such as usagi tsukino and belldandy  this can help you in determining the suitability of future articles  good luck ,0

 everything starts out as a curiosity speculation  then  if it makes sense  it becomes a hypothesis  as more evidence supporting it is found  and no conclusive evidence against it comes out  then it becomes a theory  finally  when it becomes completely confirmed and there is no way it can be false  it becomes a fact  at this point  with two incredible pieces of evidence and a wealth of more minor evidence  and nothing really strong going against it  this thought is at the point of being a theory  and theories deserve to get into articles  note some theories even have their own articles tl ,0

polemics  rehashing old claims  fighting over perceived biases and trying to blame each other for w hate ver will not solve this problem  i perceive that the fundamental premise of the dominant editors holds that any critique of the prevalent analysis in this article must begin and end within the terms set by the proponents of that analysis  this is not logical  to elucidate and support an alternative proposition is not bound by any other disciplines a priori  asserted or even purported evidentiary claims to knowledge  historical critical biblical theologians have no automatic nor exclusive claim to authority in this matter  neutrality in this instance is clear  the article must provide context to the reader about the question  show the various positions and approaches taken in different fields  and ensure that no single claim to exclusive authority or evocation of essentially meaningless and conflictual universal generalisations is present  it can not possibly be any clearer  the article is fundamentally flawed in two ways claims to exclusive authority and circular and self referential evidentiary support  if we welcome a diversity of perspectives  educate the reader  and all show more respect and dignity to each other we will surely end up with one heck of a great article  what do you think ,0

 list of interpretations from my reading of it  the third item in this list doesn t fit with the way the list is introduced the contemporary scholarly debate about race and intelligence involves both the relatively uncontroversial experimental results that indicate that average iq test scores vary among racial groups  and the relatively more controversial interpretations of these iq differences  in general  contemporary interpretations of the iq gap can be divided into three broad categories culture only or environment only interpretations that posit only non genetic causes  e g socioeconomic inequality or minority culture membership  that differentially affect racial groups  and partly genetic interpretations that posit an iq gap between racial groups caused by approximately the same matrix of genetic and environmental forces that cause iq differences among individuals of the same race  insufficient data no meaningful interpretation can be made based on available evidence the problem seems to be that isn t an interpretation  but rather the lack of an interpretation or the inability to empirically distinguish between alternatives and i ve been brainstorming for a simple fix  but i can t think of one  the best alternative i can think of is to remove from the list and add a follow up sentence saying something like a large minority think there is insufficient data and no meaningful interpretation can be made based on available evidence this isn t as nice because more experts chose than in the s r  survey july utc  ,0

 unblock me you  ass hole s  unblock hahahaha one of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party i attended in high school  it was near the end of the year  and everyone was letting loose  the party had not gotten too badly out of control  and was finally winding down i was dating karen at the time  we d been going out for about six months  we knew our time together was growing short since we d soon be heading off to college  she to radcliffe  and i to johns hopkins  we were taking every chance we could to be intimate  i d been with a few girls before  but karen had been my first long term intimate relationship  and we d taught each other lots the party was at keith s house and we were helping him clean up  there were only six of us left  karen and i  keith  his girlfriend linda  tom and his girlfriend sue  linda lived just a few doors down and had invited karen and sue to spend the night  tom was going to spend the night at keith s house  conveniently  linda s parents were out of town until tomorrow noon  so nobody really had anywhere they had to go  and once we d done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax keith was my best friend  we had a lot in common  even if we were a bit of a mutt and jeff in appearance  both of us tall  i had a wide body  result of my hawaiian ancestry  while he was lean and blonde  i m but he had a good inches on me  and had long hair past his shoulders  mine is brown and curly  and usually just goes whereever it wants  i m strong as an ox  he s lean and fast  but we had similar taste in women  on more than one occasion i teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with linda  our high school goddess  and he was extremely envious that i had karen  our big breasted  sex  bombshell  as my partner karen and sue were close friends  if we d had diana here  the triumvirate would have been complete  they had all been innocents until that year  diana was dating  and karen told me that she and ryan were  almost there doing everything except the final act  karen hadn t done much of anything until we d gotten together  but we didn t let grass grow under us  and we made up for a lot of lost time  we d had sex plenty  and she d  suck ed me off more times than i can count  i d even fuck  ed her incredible tits a couple of times  sue  it turns out  was the late bloomer  she was still an innocent according to karen  kissing was as far as she d gone  although it seems she d rubbed tom s dick through his pants  and he d had his hands on her mound  even if the underwear was still in the way  but karen was hinting that this party might be tom s lucky night we were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party  linda in particular was a lurker  she d sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs  there were some really desperate people here tonight  she said  can you believe gary tried to get a game of spin the bottle going i can t say i really blame him  i answered with a grin  not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends  or any girlfriend for that matter  hell  i wouldn d mind playing it now  that earned me a poke in the ribs from karen sue chimed in  why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like spin the bottle  post office  or strip poker now that s a stupid question  keith answered  and why is that linda asked  pointedly  isn t it obvious keith replied  no  linda and sue answered in unison  do you want to tell them keith asked me with a nod so i explained the obvious  because they are desperate and sometimes it works  oh please  karen said keith was a real instigator  you guys have never played spin the bottle the girls looked at each other  maybe a few times  but certainly not in the last year  linda finally answered  and how about truth or dare keith continued egging them on  well sure  but usually only with people we know really well  karen answered this time  usually  keith echoed with a grin  and it s not like you ve never played strip poker  the girls looked at each other quietly no one answering  oh come on  i teased  karen i know you ve played strip poker  not really  i watched part of a game  but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room  why  i suppose you ve played it she asked with a dangerous tone in her voice  sort of  in camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere  i confessed  drawing a laugh from the guys  l,1
 something anonymous editing has given rise to  vandalism manifesto  pass to all wikians  vandalism is good  vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm  vandals do their thing all over wiki from frustration and hatred because incompetent editors who have no skills  no degrees  no expertise  usually no names  have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others  vandalism is a good and natural response to no lifers  as in get a life  who  do edits edits a year and who have actual watch lists of or more and are proud of it  these  jerk s deserve have their own pages vandalized  over and over as long as they are in effect  vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop  vandals keep no life editors  admins bureaucrats and stewards honest  or at least busy  reverting the reverts they get on their own pages  vandalism is good  it helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns  the culture of wikipedia is very very sick  and vandals are needed to cull the herd support your local vandal vandal god ,1

  now that is a heavily biased remark if i ever saw one  talk about racism  and no  arguments like korean is a nationality  not a race doesn t make my accusation any less valid  because then i would just say talk about anti korean bias or anti korean prejudice  true  appletrees may have some antagonism towards the japanese  though i suspect it s only towards ultranationalistic japanese who he she feels has affronted korean nationalism but making such blanket statements like the one above isn t any better  yes  i identify myself as korean as well  but i know idiocy when i see it  be it korean  japanese  or otherwise and just because everyone on this world uses sea of japan doesn t mean that it s not valid to investigate why  or to ask the question is that the right thing to do saying things like everyone on this world uses  sea of japan as if it were the end of the debate for something as nebulous as the way things were named in the imperialist era is not only intellectually stifling  but also works to limit free speech  ,0

 a reference such as visa information iata  retrieved june is practically useless  if and when the link goes dead  the reader who tries to verify this will stumble upon really simple issues  so the publisher was iata  but what is visa information a single web page about all visa information  a web page about some specific visa information when was the information originally published  can it be found in some old iata publication as opposed to a web site  etc etc  that s why a mass change from truly bare links to this format while clearly well intentioned is still essentially useless as a solution to the bare link problem i replied to you on the article talk page  useless or not  it s not a bare link per wp bareurls with which you keep tagging the article  but as i ve said if tagging the article with a wrong tag gives you joy then i won t interfere  be joyous my friend  i ve invested a lot of time into that article  and it would be nice if you ve found something you don t like to actually try and fix it instead of adding those maintenance templates  but i guess we are not all here on the same mission  some are here apparently just to stubbornly diminish work of others  even if proven wrong  ,0

 the very naive perspective this was stated there was no implication that all vnr s are propaganda if  some vnrs are demonstrably propaganda  which i infer is undisputed  then the statement is factually correct and ideologically neutral  separated into two concepts a  that there was no implication that all vnrs are propaganda and  b if  some vnrs are demonstrably propaganda then the statement is factually correct and ideologically neutral  in regards to the first a video news release by the government  which is as they  a priori  are intended to create the appearance of congruity for an idea which aids the government through causing an apparent or actual concordance between the beliefs of those in control and those being controlled is  by definition  propaganda  in regards to the second is the statement that the labeling of vnr s is an ideologically neutral act it would not be  as  through labeling it  one is categorizing it ideologically  please do not misunderstand  imho vnr s are an advanced form of embedded propaganda which elegantly use the psycholinguistic concept contained in the idea the fish do not see the water in communication studies  propaganda studies  even neuro linguistic programming nlp  which  while it is a controversial system  is based on common sense slight of mind techniques the sandwich formula of true statement statement intended to be perceived as true true statement  is being used here  example o clock news  tired americans sit down to eat and watch the news  in the middle of verifiable and true information segments a vnr is placed  so the end effect of  rain tomorrow vnr information gas is up by cent  is to believe new facts  not and one to question my cents  ,0

 random tagging your revert of my random tagging was rather disappointing behaviour  for someone with so many gas i would have thought you would apply some common sense and actually look at the tags in question and the problems identified with several sources  rather that claim ownership of the article as top contributor  needless to say that when one source leads to a page and another is some commercial menu which does not match the citation because it has probably been removed and defaults to a home page  that is not random it is logically applied tagging based on factual concerns regarding the citations  please don t waste my time making bullish reverts without first being aware of the problems  you re not the only person in the world with a right to contribute towards that or any other article  which  sorry to say  is pretty abysmal quality  also  the link to cowboy worded as vaquero could be considered an wp egg  but it s also a pointless one as the latter article exists and there are differences between a cowboy and a vaquero  so the american word should not be used to mask the iberian version of a cattleman if that s not what it means there is an entire atlantic ocean and several thousand miles between them ,0

 having worked in radio for years in the harrisonburg  virginia area  and having worked for wacl rock  for years  ending in i have respectfully asked that the format information for this station be changed to reflect it s official format  which is classic rock  the station s official format is classic rock  not rock  album oriented rock and not active rock  i received this response from users who will not allow me to edit the content myself i talked with that other user and he said since wacl makes no clear distinction in its marketing  and based on the station website and group website  it doesn t  either rely on the arbitron listing  which is derived from the station s own reporting it should fall under the rock label  not aor  or classic rock  just plain old rock  i will make a note in the article that the station plays a blend of classic rock and active rock neutralhomer talk in my opinion  the accuracy of the content depends on fact  not on how the station markets itself  and not on wikipedia users  opinions of what the station sounds like  the station does  in fact  rely on arbitron when creating sales pitches to their advertisers  and arbitron lists the station as classic rock because the station has reported to arbitron that it s official format is classic rock  having an extensive amount of professional experience in radio in harrisonburg  virginia qualifies me as an expert on this particular subject  again i ask that the following changes be made to the content on the wacl article wacl fm rock is a classic rock formatted broadcast radio station licensed to elkton  virginia  usa  serving the harrisonburg staunton  virginia  area  wacl is owned and operated by clear channel communications  history the station first launched on february with the callsign wpkz  during that time  the station would carry a country music format  branded as z on march the format was changed to classic rock  branded as cool to accommodate this  the callsign was changed to wacl  on may at midnight  wacl changed their branding to rock on april wacl began carrying the syndicated radio program nights with alice cooper  when it moved from wbhb fm at fm  now wtgd  to wacl fm at fm when the format had been switched to classic country  music wacl plays a blend of classic rock and active rock the current content is completely inaccurate and non verifiable  because i am an expert  i am considered a verifiable source according to wikipedia  allowing inaccurate information to remain in any article on wikipedia goes against what wikipedia is all about providing true and accurate information that is not based on point of view or users  opinions  knowledgeispower talk ,0

 wj didn t perform at the wma because he can t sing at all anymore  that is the real reason he hasn t toured for a decade  along with his bankruptcy  even his vocals on we ve had enough four years ago were poor and he never had a strong voice to begin with  certainly not comparable with the real king  elvis presley  jackson has had financial problems since at least due to his declining sales and popularity  as well as his inactivity and having to support an entire family not just those three children who aren t his biologically  in it was revealed he was in debt to various international banks to the tune of tens of millions of dollars  and after losing those lawsuits in may he was confirmed as on the verge of bankuptcy with debts of million  invincible was a flop because it sold less than a third of his last album  dangerous and it was all crap of jackson s few remaining fans regard it as his worst album  in jackson made it known he had to be addressed as the king of pop meaningless  self proclaimed title  he even planned to buy graceland so he could demolish it  which certainly says far more about jackson s megalomania than it does about presley  half the songs on the dangerous album were crap  especially the unbelievably awful heal the world  and it only sold million copies on the strength of his previous three albums  blood on the dance floor sold an incredibly low million and it was rubbish  yeah  wj was unique all right  as many unfortunates found out  you must know some very sad year olds if they still admire that disgusting pervert  anyway  most people know him as wacko jacko  justin is the real king of pop and like eminem he just doesn t want to risk offending wj s mentally ill fans  justin will continue to perform  while jackson s career finished a decade ago  ,0

  this isn t pure wp or  wp coatrack fits better i guess  i called it basically wp or in my edit summary for that reason but it s essentially or to suggest that al qaeda has something to do with the investigation even if it s not stated outright  the insertion of that material creates the appearance that al qaeda is somehow linked to or related to the investigation  which no sources support  that s what i was calling basically or even if it indeed isn t quite what wp or means  i should ve used a different term of course  we do original research to create articles and determine notability in the first place  but inserting a random similarity goes beyond the scope of what that research covers  the source may have said the characteristics are similar  but not that it s related to this incident or its investigation  rfc diff ,0

image edits i cant help it if you are blind have zero attention to details  the image you replaced at surat railway station is wrong for very simple reason s which are somehow beyond your ability to understand simple things  so once again  i have to explain it to you like a kid with limited understanding the same image is on the mumbai rajdhani page as being at mumbai central station  so unless you have come up with a miracle that converts mumbai into surat you are wrong the image has been taken in bright sun light rajdhani express arrives at surat between hrs so unless you have come up with another miracle ensured bright sunlight at that time  daylight may exist but not of such intensity if you would have ever visited surat railway station  you would know that the layout of the station is very different from what the image claims the building in the background is far taller than what buildings in surat are  take a ride in the local trains of mumbai you may be able to see the same building there but in your case i have my doubts so take your hollow empty threats elsewhere  except for you rarely has anyone removed the images  as for contributions  your main history is largely made up of undoing others work ,0

thanks for the suggestion  i slept it over and hope that you are feeling more up to answering my questions about the edit in question  specificaly has the community not gotten smaller was it not caused by the automobile have i not sourced the statement as asked is it not a fact is it not information does it not help inform people as to why foresters falls is not as large as it seemingly once was is it not the only peice of information in the article that bridges the span of time between and present is the usfullness of the edit the only criteria used to determine if it will be reverted or not all that i m asking is for you to explain why it is better to not have the statement than to have it  as far as i knew wikipedia is intended to contain the sum of all human knowledge  as someone who lives near foresters falls i find that this information answers a pertinant question left open by the article  why is foresters falls so small if it once had lumber mills and such i know that you said you don t want to continue this dialogue but i hope that you can understand that my frustration comes from the fact that you have  so far  not explained yourself  from my point of view it seems that you made the edit on a whim and refuse to acknowledge the possibility that it may have been a bit unwarranted  i found the information in a book on local history  i have listed the book as a source as asked  what additional criteria need to be met  please tell me  if i were to refrase the sentance  would that be better  in fact if you could tell me what criteria was used to determine that it should be removed that would be fine  because i m sure that this sentance is no worse  certainly not because it doesn t detract from the page in the first place  than any other statement on any other page  why insist on the removal of this perfectly sensible statement  just because  please answer this letter  please do not throw another stock statement at me  please do not respond to one statement i made in this letter and ignore any points you don t care to address  i would like you to meet me point for point and justify your actions  please don t block me for daring to question administrators  please don t interpret anything i have said here as a personal attack and ignore my entire post in favour of telling me not to post personal attacks  please don t treat me like an ant under your feet who deserves no recognition i will be in contact ,0

while your observations may be correct  why don t you just edit the text rather than leaving commentary  since wikipediat is an encyclopedia  not a blog or a forum  commentary in the text of an article is not proper  it is much more likely to be reverted than acted upon  if you wish  you may express comments about the content of the article and needed improvements or ask for comments or help on the article s talk page  see help introduction to talk pages  help using talk pages and wikipedia talk page guidelines  you also may find the following pages have useful information about wikipedia  wikipedia identifying reliable sources  wikipedia verifiability  wikipedia no original research  wikipedia neutral point of view wikipedia what wikipedia is not  getting started  introduction to wikipedia  wikipedia simplified ruleset  and wikipedia simplified manual of style  thank you ,0

the bereans i did some research and i have to agree with you that it is only this bereans website that is openly labelling soriano s group as a cult  who are these bereans anyway  they are completely unnotable and i am yet to encounter anyone who actually belongs to this anti cult group  chances are they are also a cult group  or even a ghost religion  one that exists only in the internet i don t think that articles from the bereans website qualify as reliable third party published source as per wp rs  if you remove all the bereans references in the ang dating daan article and replace them all with citation needed tags  we can probably remove all of those unsourced statements within a month s time  it is unfair to use critical quotes from websites of other religious organizations because of the obvious bias  quotes should be either from notable newspapers  magazines and books  self published books not included as i will never use articles from soriano s website s  to criticize  say for example  the baptist sect  i would also not use articles from a baptist website to criticize soriano s sect  the rules must be applied to all for the interest of fairness and equality  ,0

mesopotamia as synonym for iraq  i would like to add a line to the opening paragraph to the effect that some commentators  eg ny times  slate  use mesopotamia as a synonym for  modern  iraq  this is mostly some sectoins of the us media  but is widespread enough to be noted  the present article makes very little of any modern sense of the term any comment ,0
creating subarticles as needed to bring this article to a usable length currently  monsanto is way too long to be reasonably useful as a general encyclopedia article  and much of the content  which at times goes into great detail on specific topics  would be better served in subarticles it is well over words of readable copy  reference section excluded which is approaching three times the recommendation in wp size  in practical terms  at an average reading rate of wpm  it s in the region of a hour read compounding the problem  about of the article is a poorly organized mix of product descriptions  and related political  legal and social issues and information  this is as challenging for editors as it is for readers  because it is hard to locate if and where particular details are covered on the positive side  the article s introduction is concise  readable  and seems to cover the key points history  business  social quite well a strictly length constrained direct expansion of the intro would probably result in a good main article  creating subarticles is an established  quick  and relatively straightforward way to address this problem requiring simply moving existing subsections to their own article pages and replacing them with  initially at least  the briefest of summaries that can later be expanded and refined as necessary  along with main article redirect tags based on the current article structure  the following subarticles suggest themselves monsanto legal actions and controversies monsanto legal actions and controversies monsanto products and associated issues monsanto product issues  with summary content for the two daughtered subsections  this would bring the article to an easy to navigate or so words of course  this isn t a magic bullet solution  but it will immediately bring the article to a usable length  while hopefully avoiding a breakout of contentious editing and edit warring in the main article  at least  by directing the editing of issue details to the subarticles  which could use a thorough reorganization  ,0

 i know who i am  but who are you funny you should tell me that i came out of nowhere and started reverting everyone  i ve checked your last edits and not even one appears to be a constructive addition  your edit history is pretty much a collection of reversions  sometimes just because the editor is  block in spite of the fact that some of those edits are valid and important for developing wp articles filing spi reports  teaching users about sticking to rules  as misinterpreted by yourself as they may be talking down to less experienced users  and not being shy about threatening to seek admin help  even though this was your first message to the user  with whom you never even had the chance to engage in proper discussion  and maybe other actions that may have eluded my attention  as far as i can tell  you re here for the drama  i don t even think you really care about article quality  i ve asked for a civil reply  but you preferred to keep trying to frame me behind my back for no wrongdoing whatsoever  if you want to engage in conversation  don t hesitate to do so  have a glorious day  ,0

 parting thoughts on jmh rfar  this is getting posted on every arb s talk page and i will courtesy notify doc j  i am appalled at how low the standards of wiki admin behavior have sunk  we ve seen admins lose their bit for nothing more than one wheel war and yet here we have multiple instances of involved protections  edit wars  hounding new users  involved blocks  etc  and absolutely nothing gets done about it  why  so doc j can adjust what about all his victims  what do they get diddly squat  just like in the real world  i actually truly hope doc j can change  but that is not what wiki history teaches us  wiki history teaches us he will lay low until the heat dies down then steadily go back to his old ways and he ll be back at rfar within months from now  just like the arb case from my day when a drafting arb came within a hair of posting sanctions on willbeback but didn t and what happened  will kept going on in the same old fashion and two years and countless victims later  will loses his bit and gets banned  and doc j gets to use a secret mentor  he d only not disclose that person if he felt the community would not accept the mentor  such as the mentor wasn t neutral or some such reason  by not taking this case and not issuing any guidelines or admonishments  especially with several extremely weak comments by the arbs  ie  how can some of you see nothing wrong in his behavior  all ac did here was send a clear signal to admins that there are no more admin standards of behavior and admins can do w hate ver they want and get away with it scott free  this juxtaposed with those who lost their bit for one wheel war also shows there is no consistency at all in ac s rulings on admins  at a minimum ac should have issued a statement on unacceptable behavior rather than turning a blind eye to the rfar  this is an unacceptable precedent for which the community and ac will pay for many times over in the future  the un can do a better job of fixing things than wiki and ac can  and that s really sad  this is a classic case of how those committing harmful acts rationalize their behavior and others rationalize excuses on their behalf  see you at rfar jmh talk  ,0

andrew please note this article is about a business run by a georgia tech alumni  leland strange who has been involved in the company in one way or another sine the article helps give background on other articles  visionplus was created by this compnay prior to them selling the rest of the business to first data  first data this compnay was spun out of first data tysys lists this compnay as a competitor  and one on prepaid cards the compnay makes products to support that market  there is no mention of any of the company s current products or discussion of their current sales efforts  the artilce is very similiar to the articles on first data and tysys  if you are nomintaing this for deletion then i suggest you do the same for tysys and first data  finally please note that it was reviewed by trevor macinnis and he said it was ok but needed more links which is why they were added to the other places  if the credit card one was not helpful we can delete it ,0

 correct meaning i d like to fix some details in the italian article  but as not native english speaker i need to be sure  this is my question  i suppose that official italian  trans lation is wrong about the lawsuit described in chapter the original text says they in  sti  tuted a law  suit deny  ing the obli  ga  tion to pay debts to an in  di  vid  ual with a pros  thetic heart  does this sentence mean no one is obligated to pay debts to any robot android or a robot android is not obligated to pay debts is teh italian version  but looks more logical to me because at the end of chapter andrew says i have been un  der obli  ga  tion to in  di  vid  ual mem  bers of the firm in times past  i am not  now  it is rather the other way around now and i am call  ing in my debts  thanks  ,0
greece is a country which was part of the ottoman empire  where a lot of people are turks  where they speak some dialect and they want to have the macedonian name  this is my opinion about your country and these are also facts you once were part of the ottoman empire  you have big turkish minority in the eastern part of the country  every part of greece uses some specific dialect of the greek language and you are claiming the ownership of the name macedonia  about the macedonian language  this language is recognized as official in our country and it is different from any other language in the world that fact is recognized by many relevant international linguistic institutions  i can assure you have many friends in macedonia that simply don t understand bulgarian at all  simply  macedonian language is not a dialect of bulgarian no matter how much you are truing to repeat that hoping that it will become true ,0

  ali  as i ve wrote  none of those authors are aware of many important details  such as kurekchay treaty an official and legal treaty which defined the entry of karabakh into russian empire  at the same time  the khan of sheki too signed a similar treaty  for example  i know michael croissant  and his book is full of mistakes and errors  his book doesn t mean much in this regard  his mistakes are too gross  the russo iran war started in whilst karabakh became part of russia in before such a war  meanwhile  tim potier is a good legal expert  and it is surprizing to see him write that  but everyone is entitled to errors and his was due to lack of resources he was limited as a scholar in variety of materials and legal status of karabakh in th century was not his objective  the th century was  anyways  i do not know the khans of iran in the south and which treaties they concluded with british  if they did it in the zand period  they probably had full legal right at the time  since iran was more of a geographic entity  than political  same with azerbaijan  north it was geographic too  whilst i do not remember the legal documents and letters of the time  the later russian and british documents clearly identified azerbaijanis of the north as aderbeijani tatars i have evidence of that as far back as in british census estimates and in the official russian imperial census  same word is used by russian ethnographer velichko in his book  azerbaijani author  firudin bey kocharly wrote a book in literature of azerbaijani turks anyways  azerbaijanis simultaneously fought against both iran and russia at the time  and some sided with either one side or another  unfortunately  you won t find much on that in libraries but just one such  trans lated book would allow scholars to reconsider mistaken assumptions  what is more important however  is that karabakh khan  khan being a turkic term derived from kagan was that it concluded its own treaty  that it minted its own money  one of the typical examples of independence and fought several wars with iran  some handily winning  others  like ambgiously  but still shah muhammed qajar gets killed  and i don t know who told you about vagif and ibrahim  by the later you probably mean ibrahim khan  right  well  vagif  the poet and vizier  was executed in after shah s death  and was executed by the temporary ruler  mamed bey jevanshir  who was nephew of ibrahim khan  while details are murky and contradictory  the qajars didn t have the primary rolse in this  indeed  once shah was killed  iranian troops withdrew  it screwed up all the plans to re conquering other parts of azerbaijan and georgia  meanwhile  ibrahim khan lived and ruled the khanate until tragic error or so it is explained  in but anyway  the kurekchay treaty was signed by him  thus  once more  karabakh khanate  for one  was totally independent  and iran had no legitimate or otherwise claims whatsoever to it  meanwhile  few other khanates were nominally dependent like poland was to ussr  or armenia to russia  russian speaker of parliament person in the country  openly called it forepost of russia whilst in armenia ,0

 the aim of this article  and any other wikipedia article  is that it accurately reflect reliably sources since intelligent design is a fringe subject  it s also important that we don t present it as it were mainstream science  there are atheists  and even a few agnostics  that considered id a viable hypothesis long before the discovery institute was founded so  the use of the word all in the opening paragraph is just petty and wrong well  no all of the major proponents do appear to be associated with the di no one is arguing that there were no id proponents before the di existed but as far as we can glean from reliable sources  they all ended up associated with the di if you have sources that suggest otherwise  please let us know we can only work off of reliable sources there s nothing petty about it  there is truth and there is opinion  you have written a fine opinion piece  two things one of that truth isn t something we can work with we need reliable sources i can know that something is true  but if i don t have a reliable source to support that fact  it doesn t belong in wikipedia that said  on what basis do you consider this an opinion piece are the sources misrepresented are there reliable sources that are not represented  that does nothing to support or defend evolution again  it isn t our place to support or defend anything what are the facts that support id vs evolution i think we would all like to know the answer to that question i haven t actually come across any are you aware of any reliable sources that discuss any i don t believe that there are any congratulations  you are zealots in the evolution religion  er  yeah if you want anyone to take you seriously  you shouldn t accuse people of people zealots or of belonging to some non existent religion seriously provide some sources to support your position let us know if we are missing any notable perspectives on the issue let us know if we are missing relevant sources let us know if any sources are misrepresented we re willing to listen but not to silliness like this  ,0

these four people include wlu  ohnoitsjamie  yankees and quartet  these people have been on top of me for no reason except that i edited the bench press article to remove their  champion  and put in the true champion  when wlu staed it was vandalism  i had to fight tooth and nail to get him to allow it  when yankees fought that the reference was not verifiable  i won that argument with the assistance of the guinness book of world records and the data provided by organizations recognized by the usoc  when i added a bio page for the lifter of note  quartet tried to get it removed but he failed  then when i tried to put a photo up on the site that i own the rights to ohnoitsjamie ripped it down without any mercy  keep in mind i am a new editors that has been trying to learn this process as i go  i have no delusions that my methods are blunt  i asked for assistance many times but every chance these four people always made a point to stop me from getting help to get away from them  now ohnoitsjamie gets to rule on my block  it just smacks of a kangaroo court  please don t allow this to continue for other editors ,0

 like i have said countless times over  today s mulatto  movement or internet mulatto  movement  lol for lack of a better phrase  draws all its esteem from the counterproductive denigration of black people and nothing else  i put black in quotes because in the united states mulatto and black aren t necessarily mutually exclusive concepts  i will go as far to say any power self identifying mulattos have or hope to have will always be in relation to black people  but what these mulattos fail to realize is that their very existence promotes race mixing or encouraging mandingo date  marry  and impregnate mary sue which whites  no matter how much you cozy up to them and try to delink yourself from blacks  will innately reject and perennially frown upon  i am sure there are black mulatto men who would take advantage of the mulatto movement to sleep with as many white women as possible white women who were not accessible before interestingly  people at the helm of the mulatto movement more than likely turn out to be quadroons or octoroons  it s fascinating because there is a hierarchical paradigm that is followed  and what s funny is that i can imagine hexadecaroon s forming a quadroon movement that not only denigrated black people but mulatto people as well  you gotta love this stuff  lol ,0

 agree strongly with bilcat  the comparable list should be there to illustrate what might be in the air at the same time  doing a broadly similar job  on the same side  on the opposing side  or neutral  the facts  hopefully  in those articles should make it clear how comparable planes are  and importantly make it clear to what degree one can really know and to what degree of generality  incidentally this article just suggests that the f is invincible  which i suspect was the intention  almost makes me want some afghan to shoot one down with a catapulted rock in the fanblades in reality however  it might get sand in the gearbox like those helicopters did in the desert we could always relabel the section contemporary aircraft or projected allied hostile combatants ,0

  increasingly concerned this article misrepresents bondeson s book w hate ver bondeson s credentials  i think the central claim of this article  that upon  hitler  s orders superdog members of the ss were being sought founded solely on a book by bondeson that none of us has read  is probably false  in this bbc article http w bbc co uk news uk wales bondeson complains a rise in schools of animal psychology in the s was encouraged by the  nazi s  and  hitler  in particular  and their potential military use examined  but that s a million miles away from the press claims which get taller by the day that the  nazi s had a legion of talking  machine gun toting hounds  on the point of being unleashed on the allies  at any rate  i m not sure any of this article should be taken seriously until someone actually reads the book  the only source for the material  rather than second hand  apparent misreadings  according to bondeson in the bbc article  by the likes of the sun  do wikipedia articles about books get routinely written without the book having been read ,0

update of the article  chris ojigbani thank you very much for helping me out in my article on chris ojigbani  it was my very first article here and i learnt from your help  after i read your message that i should put more references  i put them  later i noticed that one of the refrences i put may not be permitted because immediately a warning tag came on the article  saying i should use secondary references  that made me to suspect that the reference i picked from the website of pastor chris ojigbani may be the cause of the tag  i put a reference from the about us of ojigbani in the space where the article says that he considers his ministry is not a church  so i put that reference because in the about us  it stated his ministry is not a church  but when i saw the tag  i removed the reference and was able to see an article from a newspaper that states ojigbani s ministry is not a church  but after changing it  the tag is still on the article  i don t know how to remove it  kindly help check the article and help remove the tags  if okay  once again thank you very much and have a prosperous new year ,0

if you disagree with a photo  being appropriate for an article  the right way to resolve it is to discuss the propriety of the photo for the particular article rather than look for a way to eliminate the photo completely from wikipedia  if you were so sure that the picture is inappropriate  you would have expected other editors to agree with you and would not need to act through a workaround  i have seen similar tricks earlier  either way  if you want to discuss whether the picture belong to the article  use the article s talk for that  irpen,0

 binksternet hello enric  i just had a very brief discussion with  which went as follows me binksternet  user kitsunedawn has inserted a new section into amelia earhart which is redundant to the paragraph on gardner island  the new section also seems to have a bit of a wp pov issue  i d rectify the situation myself  but the page is protected  i understand you have some history with the article so i thought you might want to know about it  binksternet the added material is far too promotional for tighar  i would like to ask why you  the ip editor from northern mississippi  did not remove the text yourself  it is plainly counter to the nominal purpose of putting forward the best available information about earhart  nevertheless  i am happy to do so despite the fact that you did not do so  after i finished laughing i started to write a reply  but i realized that if binksternet could not be bothered to read as far as the third sentence of my first post then there was no reason to think that he would actually read my reply i also think that his mention of my geographic location is purposeless i am well aware of my own location this is not the first time that binksternet has started  shit  with me back in november i had this thoroughly unpleasant conversation with binksternet when i tried to correct a problem with grey school of wizardry binksternet indicates  in a picture  on his talk page that he thinks that registration should be required and while he is entitled to his own opinion  he isn t entitled to cast utterly baseless aspersions of impropriety at ip editors the last time i wanted to fix a problem with the earhart article i asked dougweller to do it  and he was agreeable i see now that i should have brought this recent problem to the attention of an administrator  but i had thought it would be helpful to alert binksternet to the issue because he has a history with the article and would be more likely to keep an eye on the situation than an admin who doesn t normally edit the article would you please explain to binksternet that i can t edit the article because it is protected and i have already explained that in my first post it isn t civil to baselessly accuse ip editors of wrongdoing when they are trying to improve wikipedia and operating in good faith ip editors are allowed to edit wikipedia thanks ,0

 subsequently eleland came along and deleted most of your modifications claiming that they were not from authoritative enough sources and that they were disproportionate within the article  eleland made a unilateral decision about all this and was quite perturbed when i reinstated the article  eleland proceeded to get into a deletion war  would not entertain discussion prior to making wholesale deletions  and then contacted administration to have the sections struck out  please check discussion for admin s response  i do not question anything said by manning  however it does not appear that he has looked at the sources as thoroughly as fluri  also eleland placed warnings on the article regarding the veracity of the citations  admittedly  i have responded vigorously in discussion  but only to protect the material that had already been checked by fluri  anyway it appears that eleland is on a messianic crusade to have it struck off the record  this is somewhat surprising given eleland s herculean efforts to include material about israel on the caterpillar inc issue  clearly eleland is not the impartial arbiter that he would have us believe under ed o loughlin but a bit of an anti israel activist himself  this is perhaps strange considering  and i quote editors must not remove information about an argument because they personally disagree with the argument  wikipedia must include all notable points of view which appear in verifiable published sources  reporting that activists have said something does not imply that the activists are correct  removing those reports because you think the activists aren t correct contradicts wikipedia s core policies  eleland many thanks for considering the situation  ,0

 mergeto watercraft date november can watercraft be merged with boat in order to simplify the articles  boat  boating  ship  watercraft  and provide a more clear article  with meaning for each would allow to add more specific and better information for each rather than give a general view modification of text for each individual article also  boating can then be described as the activity of moving a watercraft over water  something which is hard if it were only to describe boats definition should also be changed to a watercraft or boat is watercraft is a broader category of conveyances which enable passage across water  compared to boat  watercraft includes personal watercraft  which is the generic name for jet skis and waverunners  as well as canoes and other gizmos such as this a boat is a type of watercraft  but not all watercraft are boats imho a merge of one into the other is not the best way to treat them here  talk contribs i suppose w hate ver floats your boat  user talk master  ,0

  no i am not missing the point  i am disagreeing with you  since he still uses a regnal name  the other clergy argument doesn t fly  he was a pope and is pope emeritus  so his article s title should remain as close to the established convention as possible  the fact that he stepped down is not a compelling reason to drastically deviate  nothing in what you say makes any logical argument for why benedict xvi is the best form for a pope emeritus  in other words  in the formulation because x  the unmodified regnal name is the most appropriate for a pope emeritus you have yet to supply x  this seems to be more about your personal preference than rules or logic  also  since the article should match the other popes after he dies  what we are really talking about is what to call him while he is alive  does it really make sense to drop pope then add it back  what is the difference  keeping the article where it is no more suggests he is the current pope than pope john paul ii does or that queen victoria suggests she remains a current monarch  even in the unlikely situation that someone arrived here from random article and momentarily thought he was still pope  that would be cured immediately by the lead  the resignation section  and the discussion of his pontificate in the past tense  no case has been made for this change  so i don t see why you expect everyone to agree to make it ,0

  i can t quite figure it out  the system of numbering dynasties was developed by manetho in the thirtieth dynasty  so it isn t often applied to later dynasties  but it looks like the second period of achamenid rule  following the thirtieth dynasty  is sometimes called the thirty first dynasty  one might count the ptolemies as the thirty second dynasty  but i don t know if any reliable sources do so  they re either called the ptolemaic dynasty or the ptolemies or the lagides and counting them as number instead of would ignore the argead dynasty  alexander the great  his son alexander iv of macedon  and philip i arrhidaeus which ruled briefly but probably as long as some of the minor numbered dynasties  i can t see any reason for counting the ptolemies as number unless sources address the issue  i think attempts to give the ptolemies a number should be left out of the article  ,0
 yet  lk is claiming that there is a consensus of opinion  see below this is extraordinary  revisionist definition of consensus with regard to the rfc should this page discuss only right libertarianism the conclusion has been stated thus the consensus was libertarianism should be broadly construed to include all significant viewpoints from reliable sources  the definition of consensus is defined in english as  firstly general agreement and  secondly group solidarity of belief or sentiment  wikipaedia s own definition goes on to declare that  the formal process of achieving consensus ideally requires serious treatment of the considered opinion of each group  member  those advocating the adoption  say  of a particular course of action  genuinely wish to hear those who may be against the proposal  since discussion  it is supposed  can only enhance ultimate consensus  the hope is that in such circumstances action  or the adoption of group opinion  without resolution of dissent will be rare  the dispute has not been resolved in any way  there has been little  read  no  compromise by the parties on either side of the dispute  the parties on both sides of the dispute remain as in trans igent as ever  no consensus has been achieve on this issue why has consensus been claimed  in regards to such a polemic issue  when no such consensus exists ,0

 dear administrator this morning i edited derrick bell s page and added a link from a nyt article that state that one of his famous essays  the trade spacers is considered antisemitic by many people a few hours later  the addition was deleted i posted it again  and noticed that another user did the following march hj mitchell  talk contribs m bytes protected derrick bell  violations of the biographies of living persons policy  i found this action abusive as bell has been dead for months i proceeded to go to this user talk page and posted the following i find it very interesting that what you continuously delete is the comment that space traders is considered an antisemitic essay  even though there was a link to the original article from nyt where it was discussed and prominent professors like dershowitz have discussed the antisemitism in that work  there is no vandalism involved and to be honest it is arrogant and totalitarian to just lock the page under false pretenses because you disagree with people s philosophy  the reason that people have started shunning wikipedia is exactly attitudes like that to prevent a free flow of facts  if someone had written about the opinions of the faculty that bell left the deanship at oregon law school because he was going to be fired since he spend all the time lecturing away from the school  i could understand that  but there are articles about his antisemitism  bell s page does not even include his racist comments about clarence thomas  the choice of clarence thomas replicates the slave masters  practice of elevating slaves willing to mimic the masters  views  also  prioryman  name calling people you disagree with dunderheads really diminishes wikipedia and perpetuates the impression that most administrators are bigots the user not only did not have the courtesy of replying to my comment  but deleted it i posted the following later march utc dear hj  do you represent the wikipedia censorship brigade  i do not usually engage in conversations here so please let me know what i did wrong and you deleted my comment that there are nyt article s about bell s antisemitism  as well as questioning why you locked the page since bell is dead  i am a simple person  the type of people that wikipedia was supposed to inspire to all contribute but totalitarian behavior like the one yo have exhibited both at bell s page and here are what sours people with wikipedia  is not it bigoted behavior for prioryman to call people that have opposing views dunderheads i am sorry but ypur behavior  as well as prioryman s  along with your sarcastic tone in history is what diminishes wikipedia and makes you equal to the totalitarian freepers  the facts are the facts  is not the gray lady a sufficiently legitimate source then that user pressed the bell so i will be  block i may have been naive and thought that senior members in wikipedia have these talk pages to discuss the issues  i was not trying to harass or attack anyone to the contrary  i have been totally respectful of everybody  however  if the behavior that i encountered today is the typical behavior of the administrators senior staff  then it is really sad that this great endeavor has degenerated to  a site where only political correct speech is allowed  or it may be because hj lives in england where free speech is not allowed  as americans  that s one of our liberties that is cherished and should be defended  free speech is what makes us different from europe and has allowed intellectual thinking and academic research to flourish  instead of remaining stagnant as it happens in europe i am really surprised by this whole behavior  is this high school  or what  we are all adults and we should engage in conversation  not call mom when we do not like something  my ten year old does this  not an adult  ,0

  once one goes beyond the level of  say  the national enquirer  the issue is not whether the source is reliable for any particular fact so much as whether the source is overweighting material that tends to attract more mass market interest wikipedia was not created in order to just attract eyeballs the problem with  say  the fox nation  and the huffington post  in other words  is not that they lean right or left  respectively  but that they have a populist lean such that some discretion is in order for w hate ver reason  there is a lot more editor interest in adding  often without context say  what o donnell said about mice with human brains on tv than there is interest in adding what a more boring politician like mitch daniels said to the economist and there is undoubtedly more reader interest in o donnell than in daniels as well but our obligation here is to be encyclopedic the encyclopedia britannica is often found in academic libraries where it is read by stuffy people who are more interested in an informative read than an entertaining one  beyond this  one has to ask how many quotes of this sort even fox news or huffpo would have if they were to have a single story on o donnell  which is what we are constructing here all this to say that an edit that introduced this quote would be considerably more likely to have a consensus supporting its inclusion if it replaced some other controversial  widely criticized or ridiculed remark by the article subject as opposed to adding to them  ,0

 mattisse  please believe me that i had no intention of pre determining the outcome of the gar as i said  i hadn t even read the article with any great attention when i put it up for gar i then read it  and said that in my view it passed i could well be wrong  i m willing to be put right in saying that the prose was ok but not great  i was thinking precisely of wp wiaga which requires of a good article that the prose is clear and the spelling and grammar are correct  this is a lesser hurdle than the professional quality required of an fa to say this is not a criticism of ga now  again  i could well be wrong with my understanding of the current standards at ga i have done plenty of ga reviews in my time  but not recently this is why i pinged geometryguy  an uninvolved editor who has great experience with ga  whose views i respect enormously more generally  the point of gar is to seek comments from the broader community again  if i  or anyone else  wanted to ride roughshod over the ga process  we d simply have reviewed the article and passed it forthwith but no  my purpose in putting the article up for gar was to defuse the conflict  and get a broader spectrum of views the purpose was also to separate out the question of the article review from the issue of the block at gar  we re judging the article  not the editor  or even the reviewer i m sorry if for you this experience has been horrible  i certainly have had no intention to attack or bully you  and indeed have not attacked or bullied you  talk contribs ,0

yea you just removed sourced material that contributes to the article  so sorry  i have posted numerous links to job cuts explicitly caused by obamacare  not only the ibd list but ceos of companies with over employees  they all explicitly cited higher taxes costs associated with obamacare  they didn t cite the academic bull shit  being spewed forth here and elsewhere  such a shame that real life doesn t jive with the total nonsense bull shit  that is written on the wiki page  and it was supposed to create healthcare jobs  yet was the slowest year for health care job growth since december was the first month on record that health care employment actually declined  http finance yahoo com news fascinating nuggets another bewildering html,0
i disagree  considering you are willing to completely disregard the blatant abuse and personal attacks  under wp npa  i have been subjected to over the last course of days  ranging from bad to worse and when i call out the an obsession with my person  you block me  it is an obsession and of the unhealthy kind  when one edits mainly to provoke  single out and claim falsehood about editors citing conspiracy like hidden motives  there are no constructive edits  yet you only seem to be only concerned with me  they can pretty much carry on in no unclear terms  also you have made a point of advertising my block in te talk thread of an article rather than keep it limited to my talkpage  i see where this is going and it is beyond justifiable or fair  policies should apply to all  but clearly it does not from these events ,0

millitant islamism like it or not groups like al qaeda and hezbullah use the word jihad to describe their terrorist activities  even  nonviolent  groups like hizb ut tahrir use that line of rhetoric  the article must reflect that in a section of significant size  since this is in fact a significant topic  any addition to this section should be of high quality  researched and sourced  those who have strong opinions on this matter but little knowlege should rather read on the subject than write on it  it s important that the encyclopedia entry seem encyclopedic in its quality  jihadism isn t only a problem for the united states  terrorist attacks have occured in indonedia  in egypt  in bangladesh  all for roughly the same reason  all using jihad as the description of their actions  if i have time  i ll participate in this too ,0

you recent addition to super bowl xl for your information  i removed the following addition you made to this article in a recent interview with the nfl network  a referee from super bowl xl has defended many of the calls made by the officials  he went through them and has explained why the nfl believes that the correct calls were made  however  he does believe that the low block on matt hasselbeck was a mistake the problem is that you cite a link to a blatantly copyvio ed video of pereira s entire segment that was recorded in its entirety and converted to a wmv file  personal websites as secondary sources are not acceptable  see wikipedia reliable sources for more information  thanks  talk ,0

nah  i never really noticed any issues like that growing up in northern lancaster county most people just accept it as a way of life  and when i was young i thought there were amish everywhere  not just primarily in lancaster county i m sure there are some youths that have yelled nasty things and i can recall a couple times where the newspaper s police log mentioned vandalism or verbal abuse  but by and large it s not at all a common occurrence oh  apart from when the amish teenagers are playing with the electronics in the supermarket  i ll admit even i smirk at that  but people are usually respectful enough to keep their chuckling to themselves all of the amish i know are understanding that they lead a very different way of life and simply ignore any insults thrown their way as they tell me  the major concern between them and the outside world consists of two things  rising costs of living and road safety to them  public image is irrelevant ,0

 to jauerback  if one has a difference  about an edit that edit can be reverted  that s what i did since the pib report is an incorrect report  it s invalid  each and every edit or revert need to be measured in on it s merit of being valid or not  until by can prove that the pib report is correct i will not revert to my version or his version but with the standard version that existed before this issue cropped up  be fair to by if your ford car requires parts change after km run  you cannot complain to them that their product failed  the specification says km and only thing that everyone using that car is supposed to replace the parts after the specified kilometers  the pib report was submitted to the parliamentary committee which found the report incorrect  if you want your version  you must have to prove that the pib version is correct i am again submitting what the committee has to say about the pib report on which you are arguing  from the article the standing committee to which the report was submitted says there were clear factual inaccuracies in the army s deposition before the standing committee  the most glaring of them is the army s suggestion that it is carrying out trials on the arjun s performance in fact  the army has already accepted the arjun for introduction into service  based upon its driving and firing performance over the years  after firing trials in summer the trial report  written by the army  said the accuracy and consistency of the arjun has been proved beyond doubt  the ongoing trials in pokhran that the army is citing are accelerated usage cum reliability trials  aucrt in these  two arjun tanks were run almost non stop for kilometres  not to judge performance  but to evaluate the tank s requirement of spare parts  fuel and lubricants during its entire service life  ,0

religious grounds surely under canon law  a civil marriage is not valid anyway  so regardless of whether mrs simpson had been married before and regardless of whether mrs simpson had not annuled her marriages but divorced  then surely mrs  simpson was not validly married under canon law  therefore  any religious marriage she would later partake in would be a valid marriage under canon law and would make her eligable to become queen  the political implications  given that civil law is a legal marriage within the state  is a different matter but as she was divorced under civil law there surely was no hindrance to any subsequent remarriage ,0

 article contains too much incorrect information i m going to rewrite large portions of this article some time soon because the authors who wrote them don t understand what ad hominem means if there are any objections to this  please voice them here there is a very common misconception going around  that ad hominem is simply an attack against the person you re arguing with  but that is not necessarily the case likewise  an  attack  doesn t have to be name calling or anything like that it could simply be something like you are wrong because you don t have a phd in the subject  there is a very important distinction that some  but not all parts of the article make between to types of attacks  ad hominem attack your argument is wrong because of  something about the person they are arguing with that piece of evidence may be true  but how could you possibly be right  you don t have any kind of degree or certification in this area  there s no way he could be right about this area of quantum physics  the guy dances around naked in his house  non ad hominem attack you re such a n disparaging remark you are wrong because of  insert reasoning unrelated to the person these statistics from this highly credible polling agency clearly show that you re wrong about the prevelance of it why am i even arguing with this idiot i should really learn to stop arguing with someone who couldn t even get a ged  that s it  you re too stupid to argue with  bye  here s a comprehensive study showing why you re wrong in the future i suggest that you take some courses in this before arguing about it  see the distinction if there s any confusion  i can clarify further please note that there is an exception of sorts  if the person you re arguing with is the subject of the argument  then you can attack the characteristics of the person which are relevent to the argument although i m not sure if that s really an exception or just not considered ad hominem to begin with it depends if you define ad hominem as attacking the person as a basis for your argument or attacking the persno as a basis for your argument in place of attacking their argument  the latter definition has the exception built in  since you d be attacking the person in addition to  not in place of  their argument july utc  ,0

 if there is a credible link to a us gov t definition for the capacity of a tradable barrel of oil  then it should be referenced in the main article as the article states  there are several definitions for the capacity for a barrel or gallons i highly doubt that the us gov t is or was responsible for defining the capacity of a barrel of crude oil used for commerce  or that it is a world wide legal requirement to use a us gov t definition  but if there is any such legal requirement then again a reference should be stated in the main article to say that nymex has no legal right to define measurement units is a bogus argument what nymex has is the right to define or specify units that are pertinent to trade if nymex states that oil is to be traded in terms of barrels  then it is not illegal for nymex to state the capacity of this thing called a barrel in terms of unambiguous standard units  or to point to an authoritative source  authoritative as far as nymex is concerned  that defines the capacity of a barrel  ,0

 complex issue this is quite a complex issue  there have been a few cases around the world where individual officials have solemnised marriages  e g  france  greece  quintana roo in mexico i don t think these jurisdictions should be included in the template  since there is no generalised recognition of same sex marriage or possibility of generally entering into a legal same sex marriage  however  what we have in alagoas seems a bit different  i am prima facie in favour of including alagoas based on the reasoning of user denisxavier  however  before we include alagoas  we need a bit more information about how brazilian marriage law works  in particular  i have two questions  when an opposite sex couple wants to enter into a marriage in brazil  how do they do it  are legal marriages registered at a civil registry office  which conducts a civil ceremony and provides the marriage certificate  what is the role of the judge in these marriages  also  what is a notary are they a state official working in a civil registry office  or a private person who can register marriages  the issue i am interested in here is  is the process for entering into a same sex marriage identical to entering into an opposite sex marriage in alagoas  or are there administrative procedural differences  are civil registry offices notaries obliged to register same sex marriages in alagoas  or are they merely allowed to do so  if they are not obliged to do so  then i think it s more problematic to include alagoas in the template  because it means that the law is not being applied consistently  the fact that the highest federal court has not yet ruled on the matter is in my opinion irrelevant  when the supreme court of california legalised same sex marriage in california  we still included it in the template  even if the supreme court of the us did not yet give its opinion  wikipedia is flexible enough that it can accommodate to changing realities  if a superior court strikes down the lower court  then all we need to do is simply change the template again  this has been done a few times already  cheers  ,0

as it stands now the page is unintelligible to a reader not already familiar with the topic and it is worthwhile to completely rewrite it from scratch it unnecessarily introduces confusing terms  mesirat nefesh  yehareg ve al ya avor chillul hashem  kiddush hashem  some of which are not explained at all it confuses the term mesirat nefesh citing both a literal meaning  dieing for the faith  and a figurative one  trying really hard also it misses many of the most important aspect of the law  the biblical references  deut leviticus a person is not punishable for sins committed under duress even if it was still forbidden i started rewriting it and found that the only way to present it was in context of pikuach nefesh this is the exception to the general rule  if you don t explain the rule the exception makes no sense after a few tries i gave up tring to rewrite and decided a redirect would make more sense ,0

 your block and more  you continue to become involved in issues over mattisse whenever she notifies you  though i and you yourself have noted that because of your previous involvement over the drapetomania article  you may have a conflict of interest  as for the supposed personal attack  mattisse was talking about herself and i commented on how i didn t know they let old ladies on oil rigs  mattisse referred to herself as a grandmother in the past  calling someone old and a lady is inoffensive  if i called someone a hag or on their death bed  then you would have a point  but unfortunately  nothing occurred here except your inability to properly manage your job at wikipedia  your ignorance of my attempts at mediating the arguments over the caisson  asian architecture  article and past attempts in helping mattisse over drapetomania and psychiatry is disappointing  i would hope that someone of your position would accumulate a background of knowledge before taking such drastic attempts of warning and blocking other members  also  your arbitrary decisions while ignoring evidence of the other party s violations is repulsive for me to see on a site such as wikipedia  i hope that a formal review of your conduct will be undertaken  and in the meantime i will assemble evidence of improper conduct on both your part and mattisse s on behalf of the populous of wikipedians ,0

  hate  speech is serious  mr malber as i recall  your involvement with wikipedia review was because you were guilty of  hate  speech  in that you suggested that people with autism should not be allowed to edit wikipedia malber  you are a poor person to comment on such an issue you should have been banned from wikipedia for your comments  yet here you remain  continuing with your  hate  speech you are quite correct that amorrow engaged in  hate  speech  although of a lesser variety of the kind used by you he was banned  as you were you  malber  were banned for  hate  speech did you forget this perhaps you forgot this the place that is the only place devoted to criticism of wikipedia is indeed important you can disagree with as much of it as you like criticism  by its very nature  is not generally accepted by those who it is critical of this does not illegitimise it there are many and varied very legitimate criticism one such criticism is why a  hate  monger such as yourself is not banned from wikipedia perhaps you are biased in this however perhaps you d like to argue how you are less of a  hate  speaker than anyone who has ever posted on wikipedia review as far as our evidence has proven  you are much worse than the worst on wr yet here you remain  free to post on wikipedia strange that  ,1

this has nothing to do with the edits we are discussing  but  since israel is widely seen as violating every obligation under the geneva conventions  state terrorism is one way of reading the history of its occupation  it important that israel s case as being a victim of the people whose land it steals  colonizes  and whose people it terrorizes or abuses  be stated  but it must be balanced by equal weight  i e balancing israel s victim narrative with that of the palestinians  you are not allowed to overstep the limit and edit in such a way that makes out either narrative is more important  or deserves more attention  than the other  which is what you did  ,0

 you say no  trans women believe this  it has been called a riddiculous straw man yet if one goes to tsroadmap com and or lynnconway com and googles  in the search boxes you would see on their pages brain sex they will get many hits  read the theory that prenatally established brain and cns structures determine innate gender feelings and gender identity  it appears that if those brain and cns structures are masculinized in early pregnancy by hormones in the fetus  then the child will have male percepts and a male gender identity  independent of whether the genes or genitalia are male  if those structures are not masculinized in early pregnancy  the child will have a female percepts and a female gender identity  again independent of the genes or genitalia  as in the case of intersex infants having ambiguous genitalia  there are undoubtedly many degrees of cross gendering of brain and cns structures  so that while some infants are completely cross gendered others are only partially cross gendered  verbatim this is basically the feminine essence theory  when one adds that there is only one way to be cross gendered in the brain  and that cross gendering must be totally separate in any and every way from  sex orientation  that there is in essence one way to be feminine  that is the feminine essence theory interestingly if i understood jamescantor correctly in a conversation we had on my talk page this is very close to what he and sexologist like him belive  however they contend that the way in which a brain is cross gendered depends on  sex orientation thus take a homo sex  male homo sex  males have been shown to think and have some brain structures like those of straight women a homo sex trans  sex  is just a case where there is more enough female brain structure present to make a person mentally female while non homo sex trans  sex s  if i understood correctly  also have cross gender structures in their brains  just not the same as a homo sex trans  sex s the non homo sex  mtf  trans  sex  brains retaining more masculine brain structure that is the crux of the problem isn t it now that blanchard s theory not only contradicts the feminine essence  female brain sex theory of mtf  trans  sex ism but it then says ok one kind of  trans  sex  really does work that way so much heat and anger caused by so little ,0

 please answer my questions  it will help clarify exactly where any issue may be  also please note that there was a change in the layout of the table  there are contradictions and i have supplied secondary sources for those i considered that needed them  if there are specific cases that you consider need clarification  please note them here  i have removed the direct comparison of tropes in the table so as to discourage the eisegesis performed by ross nixon  i did not forget the but only with care clause  this is an inappropriate pov accusation of yours  it has nothing to do with either reading the text or the table  it seems to be similar to that of ross nixon who talks of harmonization rather than what is actually written  which is the aim of the table  until you actually see what is written  you won t read it for what it says  then you can harmonize if you need to  but the desire for harmonization is pov  harmonization is an interpretative act upon the primary sources and that would need secondary sources  you haven t explained your claim that e very cell needs to have a reference from a secondary source can you give a specific examples with some explanation of cells that need references from secondary sources  you have not been able to communicate what your specific issues are  so i fear your lack of specificity is endemic of a lack of substantial complaint control  ,0

 race genetics addressing crusio s comment  there are markers that could be looked for  for example is the pcsk  allele  this is all in the context that certain races are more susceptible to certain diseases  certain races also respond differently to medications  certain allels are prevalent in only certain races  although there is race mixing as immigration and such  the alleles are still passed on i m sure you all know i m alluding to nitromed s bidil in this case  bidil seems to help heart failure in african americans more then other races  should we not research into this would it be racist to give african americans  in the article  they were self identified black patients this medicine i think a lot of the stigma around  nazi  s and eugenics and racism has halted the academic freedom into research into this matter  people needs to understand that as an academic  one must have an academic view on things  if a particular drug helps a particular race  then why not use it  but we can t choose what results produces  we must accept them in order to change  ie  if a particular gene allele is present in one race that s lacking in others  i must acknowledge the difference in order to help develop methods to create possible genetic cures to turn a blind eye to this is not only limiting academic freedom  but is an injustice to humanity as a whole  an example is seen in the case of lysenkoism  which caused famines that killed millions  ,0

  dear mr  bunkov  thank you kindly for your note  it is always a thrill to have someone working close to a certain subject to join the ranks of wikipedia editors  welcome again  i look forward to future cooperation  and i am sure other participants of wikiproject russia will be equally delighted  that said  i feel obligated to comment on the situation you are in  pardon me if you are already familiar with what i am about to say  but i feel it s safer to include it for the sake of completeness  since you are not an individual editor but rather a representative of a government organization  you should be extra mindful of wikipedia policies and guidelines covering your position  of which he guideline on the conflict of interest is the most significant  another important point is that wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia  so it s not supposed to include any material which is purely promotional  even valid encyclopedic content may routinely be edited by any other editor  and understanding this point is vital for anyone who is planning to contribute anything  one cannot prohibit others from editing one s additions and no permission is needed to be able to edit content added by others  this  in fact  is one of the five pillars of wikipedia  this isn t to say that you must agree to each and every change others make to things you add  but all such disagreements should be resolved within the framework of applicable policies and guidelines  you ll notice  for example  that i ve made a number of fixes to the style you used to format your addition to the kaluga oblast article this is not because the style you used is somehow inferior  but simply because it does not conform to the style used across other articles in the series on russian oblasts  at any rate  style matter are pretty low on the chain of importance  and as a new editor you are not expected to immediately be familiar with all nooks and crannies of wikipedia s manual of style  you should not  however  be surprised when others fix it  style issues aside  wikipedia is all about content  of course  it s understandable that as someone close to the source of information you will have a lot to share  but the applicable policies to bear in mind here are those on verifiability and reliable sources  what this means in practice is that every statement which can reasonably be expected to be contested must have a source  and the source must be a reliable one  published by an organization with a reputation for checking the facts and or with editorial oversight  ultimately  this means that articles should be based on reliable secondary sources  and in your situation it means that sources produced by the government of kaluga oblast in general and by the agency for regional development in particular would most likely fall under the definition of a primary  not secondary  source  primary sources are still perfectly acceptable to verify hard facts  but they immediately become unsuitable once judgement is passed  in other words  it s ok to to use a primary source to back up a statement that kaluga oblast s grp in was billion rubles  but a secondary source is mandatory to back up a statement like this demonstrates the oblast s high economic potential with formalities and general introductions taken care of  let s address your question about kaluga oblast somehow being a wrong  trans lation  that actually is not the case  the term oblast is a loanword in the english language  included in all major dictionaries  and it is much more precise than a more vague region territory or province this isn t to say that any of those terms are wrong they are not but they are simply not as suitable for use in a reference work with such a huge scope as wikipedia s due to their ambiguity  this issue had been discussed on several past occasions  and the general consensus is that using a more precise term is better than using a less precise one  precision is actually one of the criteria used to select an article s title  note also that all major english language reference works use the term oblast see  for example  encyclopedia britannica additionally  since the article about kaluga oblast is a part of the series on the russian oblasts  its title is expected to conform to the same format as the rest of the articles  wp nccs is the applicable guideline covering all this  if you are interested in reviewing it  i hope this has been helpful  i apologize for dumping so much information on you all at once  but since your situation is different from that of a regular editor  i feel certain points should have been touched upon  if you have any further questions or need anything clarified  you are welcome t,0

 there was no section of gkif  there was however a section called the  other  genseiryu style that showed how this new genseiryu style came alive according to wgkf at the end of the paragraph there is a reference to gkif and people can go there to read further  however  wgkf believes that the story of gkif is wrong and is only told in that way so they can promote themselves better  the true history needs to be told in the article about wgkf  it s their viewpoint and therefore important information for an understanding of the way wgkf thinks  trains and deals with the situation  the story on the gkif page is their viewpoint  and i think they will find it important to tell this story for their own reasons i will see how this story can be rewritten  but it cannot be discarded totally from wgkf  ,0

 onih has not addressed the issue  and he has also not answered my question i said small would be more appropriate relative to minor minor reflects a point of view  small would be more appropriate  most appropriate would be to not have any modifier if the split was so minor  why are so many people still ticked off about it and it s not fair to say that the rsf folks left the movement  they just continued pursuing a direction they had pursued for years the movement is bigger than psf and pira i did not state that peter taylor is a mere journalist  if i did  my apologies to peter taylor indeed  please point it out where i used the phrase mere journalist  i did state that he has written some excellent books for better or worse  historians are not journalists they have different schools for each  in fact provos accompanied a documentary broadcast  it s a great publication  but it s not a detailed history of the provisional ira the wikiepedia entry for peter taylor states  peter taylor born scarborough  north yorkshire is a british journalist and documentary maker who had covered for many years the political and armed conflict in northern ireland  the so called troubles  from his experience he has written and produced books and television documentaries on the northern irish conflict  the entry for j  bowyer bell states  the troubles began in northern ireland in and bell s the secret army  the ira was published the following year  and was one of the first detailed histories of the ira along with the ira by tim pat coogan which was also published in many of the people that taylor interviewed were also interviewed by bell  and bell probably interviewed them first and  in some cases  more than once  though taylor probably interviewed several people multiple times  too one night in hackney states above that he wasn t using one source over another  i was using what the source actually said  but bell clearly states  as noted above  ruairi o bradaigh  daithi o conaill  and about one hundred others walked out to form republican sinn fein  so  the sources disagree at one point  i believe  the word twenty was in there it is not in there now  and from my view this is appropriate if the sources disagree we should not choose one over the other  but instead we should either acknowledge the differences and quote from each or find a way to be neutral  not quoting from either once again there has been a dispute in which one night in hackney has chosen one source over another and then when confronted with a direct quotation from an alternate source he has chosen to ask questions  change the subject  and deny the validity of the source the reality is that taylor and bell are both valid sources  and bell was clearly talking about people walking out of the ard fheis bell might have been wrong  taylor might be wrong  but we as wikipedia editors are not in a position to make that determination to do so is to engage in original research  wh  edit  ,0

 utc the thdr  the reasons were several and you re not going to like them tony blair was a war mongerer who was not in the slightest bit interested in stability or peace having such a person as a prime minister was a seriously bad idea not quite in exactly these words  but close to it  maharishi stated that if the uk population was so stupid as to vote in a war mongerer  then they were not welcome to benefit from the stabilising effects of tm on the basis that evil tends to become more obvious when there is less stabilising to counteract it  maharishi ordered everyone out of the country  or to get as fast as possible into vaastu  spiritual protecting  homes in this way  maharishi surmised that the uk population would  thick as two xing short planks as it was  overall not all of it  obviously be able to get through its stupid thick collective head that there was something desperately wrong with its leaders  much quicker and much more obviously than if the tm meditators were accidentally stabilising the country additionally  tm practitioners  by leaving the country  would not be subjected to quite so much stress the thdr  you should by now be going oh  ah  um  err  i see  and perhaps now have a clearer idea of why it would be inappropriate to put such a description onto the page which describes the  trans cendental meditation technique rather than describing the history of the  trans cendental meditation movement yes april ,0

hello i wanted to make the may it sound strange proposal to remove the muslim and osama references from the page  the official story does not connect osama to the september attack  rex tomb  chief of investigative publicity for the fbi explains  the reason why is not mentioned on osama bin laden s most wanted page is because the fbi has no hard evidence connecting bin laden to i m not a muslim but i find the words muslim extremist extremely inappropriate in contrast with the facts  i don t want the page unlocked or anything  it just cant make false accusations  there are millions and millions of muslims on the world  i figure we should at least see some evidence before we slander them as terrorists  thanks for your time anyway  drop me a line  ,0

thats a pretty naive statement  just because they get the same end result doesn t mean you can sue for intellectual rights  it s like saying daimler chrysler should sue all other car companies for breaching intellectual rights for copying their idea of a motor carriage  or the wright brothers estate should sure plane companies for copying there idea  you can only sure for breach of intellecual rights when the device uses the same mechanism to achive the end result  and such things can be legally licensed  i m willing to bet that nintendo don t own the rights to the motion sensors and license them as sony would  the only exception would be if they designed them themselves ,0

 mark the cousin  a  ne  psi  os of barnabas  ac col in luke the greek words syg  ge  non relatives  such as cousins  and a  del  phon brothers  both occur  showing that the terms are not used loosely or indiscriminately in the greek scriptures  matthew notice the word until  indicates mary did not remain a virgin her whole life  some haved to tried to argue their way out of that truth  thought the gospels several times point fact  however scholars have noted two things about the theories  that mary borne no other children  one there is a motivate behind such theories  to uphold a doctrine that arouse much later  the church teaching that mary remained a virigin throught her life  two  the theories themselves do not hold up to under scrutiny for example  one such theory suggests that the brothers in question were step brothers  sons of joseph by a earlier marriage  this notion lacks substance for it would it would actually deny jesus the legal right of inherit the kingship of david  another theory is  that were actually cousins of jesus although the greek scriptures use distinct words for brother  cousin  and relative  thus scholar frank e  gableline calls these theological theories far fetched he concludes the most natural way to understand brother is that term refers to sons of mary and joseph they were brothers of jesus on his mother s side matt jerusalem bible when jesus had finished these parables he left the district  and  coming to his home town  he taught the people in their synagogue in such a way that they were astonished and said  where did the man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers  this is the carpenter s son  surely  is not his mother the woman called mary  and his brothers  greek  a del phoi james and joseph and simon and jude  his sisters  greek  a del phai too  are they not all here with us on the basis of this text  would you conclude that jesus was mary s only child or that she had other sons as well as daughters the new catholic encyclopedia vol  ix  p admits regarding the greek words a del phoi and a del phai used at matthew that these have the meaning of full blood brother and sister in the greek speaking world of the evangelist s time and would naturally be taken by his greek reader in this sense  toward the end of the  th century  c helvidius in a work now lost pressed this fact in order to attribute to mary other children besides jesus so as to make her a model for mothers of larger families  st  jerome  motivated by the church s traditional faith in mary s perpetual virginity  wrote a tract against helvidius  a d in which he developed an explanation that is still in vogue among catholic scholars  mark jb his mother and brothers now arrived and  standing outside  sent in a message asking for him  a crowd was sitting round him at the time the message was passed to him  your mother and brothers and sisters are outside asking for you he replied  who are my mother and my brothers and looking round at those sitting in a circle about him  he said  here are my mother and my brothers  anyone who does the will of god  that person is my brother and sister and mother  here a clear distinction is drawn between jesus natural brothers and his spiritual brothers  his disciples  no one claims that the reference to jesus mother means anything different from what it says  is it consistent  then  to reason that his natural brothers were not that but were perhaps cousins  when what is meant is not brothers but relatives  a different greek word  syg ge non is used  as at luke ,0
 marx  that s just historic ignorance  stalin maybe  now  you have to be very careful with that statement  superficial statements as many communist organizations and communist leaders were known for their antisemitism can be as well stated about religion  blacks  whites  children what originally is an economic contradiction is taken as something else  just because it is convenient as anti communist propaganda  and you know very well how propaganda works  it is a misinterpretation in many cases of what is originally a communism capitalism problem to be stated as a communism religious group contradiction  if a religious group  an jew s  catholics  muslims serve the same as examples  stand in anticommunists stances then  of course  they will get reaction from the communists  the rest is just propaganda  ignorance and opportunistic intentions  ,0

hmm i remember reading about that in the news recently aswell  im sure if that did happen then the other commonwealth realms would follow suit sometime in the future  i doubt if any of the other countries would do anything until after the queen dies though  because im sure canada australia will hold referendums on becoming republics and probably win it after the queen does die  i agree with the equal rights for male females  the bit i dont understand is allowing a catholic to become monarch  how an earth could a catholic become the head of the church of england  if the uk act is passed then it would be worth a mention on this page about the legal implications for the other commonwealth realms ,0

 why the prophet jeremiah should not be censored out of this article all the abusive invective in the world doesn t alter the fact that when we consider the jew ish law  the following is relevant how can you say  we are wise and the law of the lord is with us when  in fact  the false pen of the scribes has made it into a lie  jeremiah new revised standard version it is relevant because jeremiah is a major jew ish prophet  so his opinion carries weight jeremiah lived over years closer to the time when the books of moses were compiled the fact that another contributor is so determined to remove this evidence from the public record demonstrates that the point jeremiah makes is sensitive  nevertheless it is also highly relevant to any rational discussion about this aspect of the jew ish law  and for that reason should remain if other contributors wish to argue that jeremiah s comment about scribal ethics is not relevant to biblical passages about circumcision  they are welcome to demonstrate this  however  censorship is not the way to make this point  ,0

did christians invent satan  the idea that christians invented satan is lies  propogated by some adherents of wicca and other pagan believers  we see that the holy scriptures that came from judaism has a book called job  so why blame the christians rather the scriptures reveals in genesis how eve was tempted by the serpent  who had refused to worship adam  also later we see that david is tricked into taking a census by satan  old testament samuel  later on further we see that jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of beelzebul  satan  by pharisees  jesus refutes the accusations of the pharisees  in the nt we hear that i saw satan cast out of heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the west  so also in revelations we hear that there was war in heaven and st  michael and all the loyal angels to god fought against the followers of satan and the battle was won by the good angels  revelation also reveals  woe unto man for the devil has come down to earth  being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short  also elsewhere we hear that satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour  christ was tempted by the shaitan times after his baptism in the desert  so to say that we christians invented something which was already revealed in judaism and ot is silly and obnoxious  the devil had pride  then disobedience  then jealousy  then slander  then much later we learn that jesus called the satan a liar  murderer and thief  why dont the wiccans look to zoroastriaism or other dualistic religions and see the concept of good versus evil in those religions  why  so that the christians get the blame for something that actually exists  even the muslim believe in a the serpent called iblis  and even buddhists had a concept for the evil one called mara  who was a tempter  jesus even spoke to st  peter and said that the devil had been given permission to sift st  peter like wheat  whereby jesus siad that he had prayed for cephas such that he would not enter into temptation  the truth seems to be that the devil was an arc angel in heaven  who became too full of himself  later whe god created man in his own image  god requests all the angels to bow to adam  all do except for one angel  later called lucifer he refuses based on himself being made of fire and that adam is made of clay  however  god allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in job  some mention that in isaiah  o lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the heavenn is a direct reference to the devil  but i also consider it to babyloon  as in revelation  fallen  fallen is babylon the great etc  revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life  god has talks with the satan  so satan can not be inferred thence to be a non entity  as god does not talk to non entities  also some people believe that the dark side of human nature to be some impersonal evil  others realise that this is negative non sense  i know that people were possessed by demons  fallen spirits and that jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming  ha  jesus you nazorean  what hast thou to do with us  hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us jesus then would tell the demon s to shut up or be quiet  so far as i concerned the truth is in the holy bible  some truth is also in the quran  there are some truths to be found also in other religious books  but the whole truth is christ and the books of ot and nt are inspired by the holy spirit  have a read of revelation and read it aloud to someone and you will get a blessing from god  enough of this rubbish about christian inventions of spirits  pagans invented their gods  and invented strange myths concerning their false gods jew s and christians had the opposite  god revealed to them the truth and the way  and the life thanks email  james hernon hotmail com the next seion is not written by me  james hernon ,0

 not at all  the context i m using is similar to that of bootstrapping node  how does your computer become an internet node from the ground up  to oversimplify  you can frame the question in this context  if someone wants to have control  not merely contractual use of  but principle control  of a particular range of ip addresses  how does that person actually go about obtaining that control from icann and the powers that be  within reason  this actually isn t possible  you would have to have the resources of a large corporation or government agency to accomplish such a goal  it is these large bodies that own the networks which interconnect with each other  everyone else is just renting access to one of these networks  the average user has no other means by which to connect to the internet  thus i think the notion that nobody owns the internet is a falsehood  and the myth is common enough to warrant a discussion in the article ,0

 relativism contradicts itself to propose the statement  truth is relative  it condraticts itself as identifying that statement as an absolute truth  truth is relative  is not a relative statement it is absolute thus the whole sophist philosophy is proven incorrect relative truths  however  can exist  but the idea that reality can be percieved in a truth to however a person feels it is  is simple ridiculous personally  i cannot make any sense of the previous paragraph  which just goes to show that individual reality  and therefore truth  is probably relative after all in my reality  the truth is that there are rules of grammar and spelling that should be followed if you want people to understand what you are talking about  ,0

 categories related to the national audio theatre festivals page it is unclear why a number of categories were removed from the national audio theater festivals page  i can only assume that the person who made the changes did not read the page carefully  the remaining categories imply that the natf is simply an american radio drama performance festival and artists collective the festival is not a performance alone  but comprises a professional organization not a collective or amorphous group of audio engineers  sound artists  voice actors  playwrights and producers  its yearly event  also known as the national audio theatre festival  involves several days of instruction  training  special talks and other discussions on these topics  for example  training in sound mastering  sound production  voice acting the friday night performance is the cherry on the sundae it is one of the only conferences of its type worldwide  many of the participants do not work on the radio at all  but in audio books  film or animation  and likewise  while all the training involves the audio arts  it is not just an audio drama festival the upcoming festival  for example  will be focusing on voice acting in animation several of the categories are rather egregious removals  such as audio plays radio drama sound recording  sound technology and voice acting for which natf is one of the only national training grounds or gathering for professionals  and even as other pages in those categories that are affiliated with natf or are similarly themed stay in those categories  i therefore have returned most of the categories back ,0

wp triv does not say that trivia should not be on wikipedia  just that it should not be in greater focus than the article as a whole  and the difference between the editing you described and the anon edits i reverted was that the anon tag additions were the sole basis of his edit history  you have a varied edit history  also  the tag was put on articles that it clearly did not belong on  such as articles with relevant trivia in very small amounts  and pages that were explicitly labeled as trivia  wp triv says to be cautionary with trivia  not to remove it entirely  and if you interpret it otherwise  that is an issue to debate  the anon disrupted wp to possibly prove the point that trivia does not belong in wp  which is explicitly forbidden  now  i did not judge him solely because he was anon  but because of the massive amounts of editing done by an anon in a short period of time  without any variation whatsoever  no  being anon is not enough to condemn him  neither is a specific edit to a lot of pages  it is the fact that he is anon  an d doing a massive amount of edits and said edits are not fully constructive  the toomuchtrivia tag is only to be used when trivia is so numerous as to unbalance an article  some of the pages  like the bull shit article had very little trivia  and the trivia it had was rather constructive  also  there were some pages explicitly labeled as trivia pages that got the tag  this tag was abused in this case  on the individual articles  should editors feel that the tag was useful  as was seen on the wonderful life  kill bill  and dolly parton pages  i will respect that ,0

german offer of immunity i repeat what iser yannismarou deleted simultaneously the greek government rejected a german offer of immunity from invasion in return for neutrality  p i have credited the source  you can read this book for yourself i am not saying the greeks were not heroic  or did something bad  just reporting the german offer  which was probably tantamount to capitulation anyway i realize wikipedia is a cartoon version of a real encyclopedia  as it s not peer reviewed  so i m afraid my entry will be deleted again in any event  hopefully this talk fragment will remain  ,0

 constance cumbey update on march at p m e s t squeakbox s allegations about  nazi sm and editing a rastafarian page  to the best of my recollection i have never been to such a page  my knowledge about squeakbox s rastafarian sympathies came from his own wikipedia page are nothing short of libelous and outrageous obviously he has never read my work most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of james webb on occultism  including  nazi  permutations of same nazi sm was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the thule society and theosophical society roots to the swastika itself hitler  did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of cleansing actions master races and aryanism were standard fare in all occult reading  both of rosicrucians and theosophists as far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned  there are ample books  many of which are in my personal library  showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and indian cultures the jew s were singled out for hatred in most such literature and still are in the books published by lucis trust lucis publishing company just look at the indexes  and you can do free internet searches judaism evils of judaism  need for dissolution of i have battled  nazi sm and racism all of my life  starting at age when i told an aunt  that man s not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood you re bad because you want to move out just because he s moving in squeakbox owes me an apology he confesses he flunked logic he also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument for that  i will give him in good christian style  a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations read the new age books carefully and not in an altered state  you will find that they are not all peace  light love and people who come against them are not  nazi s the kernel of  nazi sm is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde  blue eyed pagans in its ultimate world view i have many a new age book from the early s in my vast personal collection which tells orientals  africans  etc that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway as regards solana  he is smart enough to see the club of rome agenda for what it clearly is  a global population reduction and occult indoctrination program the club of rome banner is one that javier solana flies the most proudly  ,0

  no  what you said before was that the term is not used in ireland you re now admitting it is used if rarely  i happen to agree with you there government policy doesn t cover geography and as demonstrated  government policy doesn t appear to cover ff senators and tds  but then  that s not new afaicr  the dept of education essentially said not our problem when a teacher complained to them about folens using the bi term in its atlas and told the complainant to get in touch with the publishers directly to me  what smacks of a post colonial inferiority complex is the drive by a vocal minority to expunge the term from every irish related article i rarely if ever use the term myself in everyday life  i prefer ireland and britain or britain and ireland but if it does get used meh big deal i don t think it as a conspiracy to undermine sovereign ireland  put us down  offend us  somehow claim our territory or subsume us back into the union  the way some people on here seem to take it britain and ireland  though  isn t a geographical term its two different islands  i d rather just say the shannon is the longest river in ireland than the longest in b i though my preference would still be to use the worldwide common name for the island group  bastun not batsun  ,0

beagel you have not justified the removal of sourced content  there is no single item of content that would not also be excluded with your logic about the long history of the company so this argument does not work  this is your own personal judgement as per the essay wp removal it is preferable that good faith edits remain in the article pending consensus so i am restoring it you have to make a better case for deleting this gandydancer this section describes activity of bp that is fairly unique  and also pretty interesting wrt to company s efforts to do social marketing and the like it does belong in article about bp please provide more reasoning for your stance  thanks ,0

when creating a definition that effectively conveys information  we can t eliminate things that condemn ourselves i realize that self incrimination goes against human nature  but we can resolve the discrepancy by taking incrimination out of our definitions terrorism  for instance  doesn t have to be pejorative we can talk about it simply as a method of war or influence if terrorism isn t evil  then it doesn t matter if israel includes terrorism as one of its tactics  you may think that stripping any implication of terrorism from israel is good for the jew ish people  but let s look at the big picture in the information age  we can no longer keep people from researching historical data trying to subvert this information only serves to show the bias of those attempts with unrestricted global communication  manipulation of mass communication is pass i believe i can make a case for it never having been a good thing  but that is beside the point regardless of whether it was ever good to suppress and change history  one thing is certain  it is increasingly harder to do so ,0

 mc truth hey  to the wikipedian who removed the amazon link  with no further explanation  it is not advertising for the company or artist  especially since mc truth aka matisyahu is not even featured on that album in question  however  that link is crucial because the about the artist paragraph contains a band line up written by mc mystic and it is the only place besides of archive org and the jdub board that info can be found at all my point is  many articles have that nice article lacks sources citing tag  but when you add sources  someone comes along and removes them all  i dont get it  feel free to enlighten me  ,0

i am still not convinced  checkuser does make mistakes  i ve been right about nisarkand socks  who carl blunderson loves of the time so far  another checkuser is necessary to confirm  also it is possible that he is using a proxy so not only the ip needs to be looked at but also the evidence provided and yes  blunderson  i was talking to you  looking at the afghanistan talk page you have been collaborating with everyone of nisarkand s now  block  socks  either you are both afghan nationalists  with afghan nationalist povs or you are online boyfriends  which is it blunderson ps looser  don t criticize my spelling  i m not a looser like you trying to have perfect spelling when talking to morons like you  in all the articles i ve written on wikipedia though my spelling is perfect  you on the other hand have contributed nothing to wikipedia except edit warring and many blunders  i bet you are a real  dumb ass in real life and you just use spell check when writing online  after all  you have a degree in the easiest major on any campus  theology  your degree is a joke and useless and you are a joke and useless to wikipedia pps  by the way stop trying to become an admin  ass hole you have a block log and you will never become an admin with that type of record  or you can keep wasting your time since you have nothing better to do than to be here you must smell like a sock by now since i m sure you haven t showered for weeks since you re here trying to become an admin which will never happen ,0

motorsport infobox ok  i agree with what you are saying  if the information is available then it should be added  however  when i went to add the template to british formula one series  i couldn t find any data about any teams in the series  i know which drivers ran which cars  but not the teams that were running them  i suppose i could add a question mark or something like that for those fields  i can add constructor and engine info  but i m not sure how relevant it is  being as most of the cars were second hand i realise making the change to the template was a bit bold on my part  without considering why those fields might have been left  you are welcome to revert the changes back ,0

cited sources  i looked in category abnormal psychology and in abnormal psychology and i didn t find any cited sources to support the inclusion of non psychological articles in psychological categories  category  sex  and gender identity disorders is a sub category of category abnormal psychology  gender identity disorder  which is listed in dsm iv codes  is in category  sex  and gender identity disorders  related subjects and articles such as  trans  sex ism are not directly psychological subjects defined in dsm iv codes and hence don t appear to belong in either of these categories  if they did  they would belong in category  sex  and gender identity disorders  not category abnormal psychology  the fact that a suspected sockpuppet of a permanently banned user was inserting the parent category in an apparent effort to insult and demean  trans gendered people doesn t make it a valid category for the articles to be in ,0

i believe that much of the content of this article is either irrelevant  too specific  or condensable into smaller chunks a lot of it consists of what looks to be personal correspondence  quotes  first hand recollections of events  name dropping  forum posts copied verbatim  and so on further  i suggest that  since higher profile languages  such as c and java do not have seperate history pages  the relevant information in this article be relocated to the main article if for some reason it is determined that this page should be retained  i suggest that it be renamed to something along the lines of history of the dylan programming language to better conform to the standard thoughts ,0
 dan bullying hey folks dan may work for a record company  or is just a very enthusiastic fan for the artists he likes he constantly vandalizes apges where he does not like the review on aaliyah the album  he somehow twisted metacritic s rating  which means generally favorable  and said the album received highly positive reviews  which is not borne out in facts on nicki minaj s roman reloaded  which he clearly dislikes  he said excellent reviews by rolling stone and spin are inconsequential  and insisted metacritic was the most important factor he s full of sh  t  to be frank and he s a bully and when he disagrees  such as he does hear  he begins to name call  whine etc he has a few supporters who he rallies around to beef up his bogus assertions on these talk pages then he throws alot of geeky wiki speak order to bludgeon the common sense out of the article  ,0

 leejc is absolutely right  he did a better job expressing what i tried to say back in june but while i agree with his final conclusion  it isn t quite the right argument to use  that we must assume the worst  to get it  so i thought i would try once again to explain how the different wordings of this problem  that seem to say the same thing  can lead to different solutions the ultimate cause of confusion is the math specific definition of the term event  when a random experiment produces a result  that result is not called an event  it is an occurrence  event is defined to be the subset of all possible occurrences that have some defining common property  so if i flip a coin a hundred times  there are only two possible events heads and tails  there will most likely be about fifty occurrences of each event  and each occurrence will fit into only one event if i draw a card from a standard deck of playing cards  there are lots of possible events and or occurrences  some of them overlap  they include black card  spade  honor card  tjqka ace  and ace of spades  the occurrence black card can be in the event spade or club as well  note that an occurrence can fit into other events  but not vice versa  an occurrence of spade is also an occurrence of black card  but the event spade is most definitely not the event black card  since determining probabilities involves counting the number of elements in events  the difference can be crucial when less specific observations are applied there is a famous problem that isolates this difference between an occurrence and an event  it is called bertrand s box paradox suppose you have three indistinguishable boxes  each with two indistinguishable drawers  inside each drawer is a coin  box has two gold coins  box has two bronze coins  i can t resist the temptation to use the initials b and g and box has one of each  you pick a box at random  and open a drawer at random  if the coin is gold  what are the odds that the coin in the box s other drawer is also gold  i e that it is box the first issue here  common to story problems  is that this problem describes an occurrence  not an event  we must extrapolate what the possible outcomes of the actions are  to define the event  the set of possible occurrences  that defines the conditional probability the incorrect approach to bertrand s box paradox is to say that you narrowed the identity of the box to two possibilities  box and box that the event matches the observation the box has at least one gold coin  this is wrong because there are other ways to describe occurrences in that event  if you pick box then no matter which drawer you open  the occurrence is in the event the box has at least one gold coin  the correct approach is to define the event as the set of all possible occurrences where you open a drawer with a gold coin  every possible occurrence that is consistent with the problem description is in this event  remember  it s a set and every possible element of this event is consistent with the problem description  both of those conditions have to be true for the event set we extrapolate as the condition  this set has three elements  not two  in two of those three possible occurrences  the box s other coin is gold  the correct answer is i have seen a variation of bertrand s box paradox used to represent the boy or girl paradox  you are the organizer of a neighborhood swim meet  during the meet  you get a phone call from mr  smith  who is delayed and can t pick up his children after the meet  he says tell my two kids to go home with a neighbor  their names are sarah and  and the phone connection goes dead  there are four families of two children in the meet  and they conveniently include the four possibilities bb  bg  gb  and gg  what are the odds that mr  smith has two daughters this occurrence can be described as a two child family includes at least one girl  but not the event you need to use as the condition  mr  smith could have mentioned a boy s name first  and if that boy had a sister  that occurrence would have been an element of the set a two child family includes at least one girl  so that event fails one of the two criteria  you get the answer by erroneously using this event the correct event is just that mr  smith mentioned that he had a daughter  and compares to you opened a drawer with a gold coin in the box paradox  you can count four possible occurrences of that event  in two of those four  representing a single family  sarah has a sister  the correct answer is or if a conditional probability question describes an occurrence  and not an event  care needs to be taken whe,0

 counterterrerism policy strong words this is the point where the nonmuslims invite the wrath of all muslims  nonmuslim nations are weaping about terrorism and they are giving wind to the fire in muslim hearts burnt due to these type of pictures displayed on the sacred artical of muhammad  pbuh the day is near when muslims will take revenge  from the history we have seen that arabs and nonarabs have slayed their children in the name of allah nad muhammad  so if the writer of this artical muhammad and the pictures includer thinks that he is giving a good idea of getting knowledge  he she is obviously on wrong path  respect to get respect  more over live and let live  basic peaceful muslims psycology there is a need of education among nonmuslim nations especially cristians who have no path to live  in tension they are running here and there to get shelter but  let us see in next decades they are building such a mountain for them which they cant handle  the discussion is to long and i have lot more points  i dont want any one to opt the orders but to do listen and think a way out so please do not creat problems for your self  if nations like arab south asia will come to know about these pictures about which most of muslims are unaware there will be a very big problem if usa  allies want pakistan to become what they think then make islam happy pakistan will get into there clutch  more over the point to restore peace in afganistan and irag the common man in pakistan is more intelligent than the think tank in usa  since i have been to lot more places i think that policy needs to be completely revived i dont want the powerful nation to enforce a world wide civil wars and revolutions  in muslims there is nothing except faith in islam  they always unite in time of need and the internal hot talk in every streat of pakitan is integration of all the sects and nations named muslim  looking forward in anitcipation remove these pictures and become safe please do not get on to the war and kill and get killed in the hand of muslims and let us become your friends muslims have faith in jihad nonmuslims has no term like that as basic piller of religion  one way what i propose is very safe a true muslim  love for all humans regardless of borders and faith as islam ordered  best wishes  ali saeed  the game ali hotmail com ,0

i don t object at all  i came here to bring up capri sun being mentioned  myself  it is directly after the mention of powerade when i was skimming over the powerade bit of the article  i thought what was being conveyed was that they had  trans itioned some product of there s into an aluminum can  much like energy drinks at packaged  and this was the intended gist of the statement  i didn t really think it over but now that you point it out  yes that is a bit of frivolous information  i d also agree with you  powerade isn t an energy drink those are sports drinks  which to my understanding and recollection by common knowledge  are intended to hydrate and provide some salts to athletes  a much different task than the intent of energy drinks capri sun is just a sugary drink with a fraction of fruit juice on what i ve seen  though it could different depending on location where it s sold  or what laws dictate toward the content or labeling  the article on capri sun has a picture where the product advertises itself as fruit juice  every capri sun i ve every noticed  states it contains it may have however amount of juice  it isn t however  an energy drink  if capri sun is an energy drink  then anything containing sugar or corn syrup is an energy drink  the term become basically meaningless  i m slightly stroking my chin as to who may be placing those products into the article  but i do suppose it could be a mistake in good faith i am all for scratching them both entirely  i would need to see a persuasive argument against doing so to move my postion  i believe i ll be so bold as to just strike these two out  anyone finding disagreement  please do post here ,0
topic ban violation and sock puppetry hello  you had some interaction with ip  in connection with the golan heights  so accordingly  i am notifying you and stifle of a matter that is of serious concern  i have reason to believe that this ip user is nableezy trying to circumvent a topic ban imposed on him by stifle  the ban forbids him from editing or commenting on the golan heights and all areas of israel and its environs including cities  settlements and regions  the ip in question geolocates to chicago  and the edit in question is consistent with nableezy s pov prior to the instant edits  the ip never made any edits to the topic area and the first edit that he makes in the topic area is to the golan heights  nableezy is also from chicago as evidenced from his early trait page but there is more  the subject ip also made edits to a hockey article involving players in the nhl  nableezy has expressed more than a passing interest for this subject as evidenced by this but the similarities between the ip user and nableezy do not end there  the subject ip made this edit on a very technical subject involving circuitry and electronics  nableezy attended illinois institute of technology  a school that emphasizes engineering and it evidenced by his early trait list so now we have an ip who  like nableezy  comes from chicago with interests in the golan heights  hockey and it  the coincidences are too great to ignore per wp duck  the evidence suggests that the ip is nableezy s sock puppet used to circumvent stifle s topic ban ,0

 you don t provide acceptable sources  simply writing i wrote this mostly from the books of bilge umar  at the start of a long list of names and their claimed actual etymologies does not cut it  at all  i doubt for one that umar would be accepted as a source since he has done his studies on these matters in his spare time  apart from his academic career  however  should you really want to make an earnest attempt at having his opinions presented in various articles  you would have to start with presenting coherent  logical arguments and having the best possible references for each part of it that would be likely to be contested  you should also familiarize yourself with wp fringe to find out whether the perspectives you wish to present might be considered too tenuous and uncorroborated for inclusion into a wikipedia article ,0

  phenotypic variation is however very much a concept in the natural sciences  and if life scientists do not use the term white people in discussing phenotypic variation  there is a reason that an encyclopedia ought to take seriously if scientiss writing about phenotypic variation do not use the term white people  not only would it violate nor to claim that they are actually talking about white people  it would misrepresent their research which is the opposite of what an encyclopedia should do and violates npov moreover  white people is very much a concept analyzed by social scientists and we should back up our claims about them with proper sources the point  about nor and npov  remains the same  we do not use our own views  people active on this page have been discussing this for weeks and have reached a consensus on this now you turn up  which is your right but you oughtn t to disregard two weeks of discussion and insist that we repeat the whole debate now  talk  ,0

 laughable errors  the qur an also places a dress code upon its followers  for women  it emphasizes modesty  allah says in the qur an  and tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their private parts and not to display their adornment  interpreted as the hair and body shape  except that which ordinarily appears thereof  interpreted as the face and hands  and to draw their headcovers over their chests and not to display their adornment except to their husbands  their fathers  their husbands fathers  their sons surat an nur verse all those in whose presence a woman is not obliged to practice the dress code are known to be her mahrams  men have a dress code which is more relaxed  the loins must be covered from knee to waist  the rationale given for these rules is that men and women are not to be viewed as  sex  objects turkey  a predominantly muslim country  has laws against these dress codes in schools and work places  after the declaration of the republic in as part of revolutions brought by ataturk  a modern dress code was encouraged  it is against the law to wear a head scarf while attending public school in turkey  as well as france  where the recently enacted rule caused huge public controversy  is anyone implying that turkey obliges women to show their naked chests and display their  adornments turkey only banned the burqa  and it can be argued that the quran never specifically perscribed that particular dress anyway  ,0

 caucasoid  is it really necessary to mention that some uyghurs are fair skinned and have caucasoid traits  it sounds a bit like  nazi  science to me  luis rib  well  they do have such traits  you can phrase it a bit differently if you like oct utc it wouldn t be necessary if we lived in a world in which race  whether considered a real or constructed category  was irrelevant  unfortunately  that s not the case  the ethnic characteristics of uyghurs play an important role in discussions of the relationship between uyghurs and han chinese and thus how chinese xinjiang is or should be  in order to understand the politics of uyghur chinese relations  it s important to know that these characteristics are commonly discussed february utc why caucasoid traits  these traits are probably more semitic than caucasoid the more we try to parse this issue the thornier it gets  read the caucasian race entry in wikipedia and see if you can find any way to separate semitic from caucasoid  the entire concept of race is in dispute  and regardless of how people ordinarily discuss differences  an encyclopedia ought to try to avoid such uninformed hypotheses in its entries  it might be better to describe  for example  a people as having blue eyes and fair skin and lacking the epicanthic fold  as well as being largely muslim  than to try to categorize them by race  and so i d agree that dropping caucasoid would be smart  after all  much of the european population has at least some mongolian ancestry  as do iranians  turks  central asians  and so on and uyghurs are certainly included in this distribution regardless of their caucasoid traits  and if you go back far enough  i suppose the entire world population has african ancestry  you can see how this can become like an argument about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin  and has no place in an encyclopedia that is trying to be authoritative and factual  ,0
 according to wikipedia s five pillars  wikipedia is an encylopedia  not a newspaper the photo of cynthia s mugshot is something that would be seen in a tabloid newspaper  entertainment weekly  or people magazine  and that s only if they were desperate that week not an encylopedia the difference between her mugshot photo and the celebrities that you ve mentioned is that they are celebrities  and i feel she isn t a celebrity everyone you mentioned is famous enough and or their crime was  in famous enough to warrant a mugshot photo  if the reason of keeping the photo is that it relates to the article  i say that the drunk driving section is overkill it s tabloidism granted  she isn t completely unknown to the public or unpraised by critics  but the entire drunk driving arrest section should be a blurb also  her fame  or lack thereof  and the lack of severity or newsworthiness of the crime  even though i loathe drunk driving  is why the photo should be removed i think almost everyone else on this discussion page agrees with the photo removal  ,0

 lead needs to meet mos standards as it stands  the lead breaks mos in several major ways mos intro introductory text in that is does not briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it can stand on its own as a concise version of the article mos intro relative emphasis in that it gives wp undue emphasis to male rape in the uk  yet section in prevalence covers countries from which other examples could have been given  to quote mos  emphasis given to material should reflect its relative importance to the subject male rape in the uk is no more important that in any other country in the world  therefore it should not be used as a singular example because this does not represent a worldwide view  particularly as anything related to ass sex differs per culture  religion and by law the examples break the mos intro provide an accessible overview guideline which states do not hint at startling facts without describing them  the uk percentages are quoted without sufficient background to explain their relevancy this early in the article  there is no context because the lead is very short and uninformative mos intro relative emphasis significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article the stated uk and figures are not mentioned in male rape united kingdom  which would be a more appropriate place to account for these percentages  than in the lead in this disconnected manner the lead needs rewriting be someone who has contributed to this article and knows the sources well  it should be much longer based on the article s current length  it should be balanced and not given to undue examples from cherry picked county data  per wp npov  it needs to give a concise overview of the topic  rather than focusing on too many examples  to avoid clutter ,0

  i have been deliberately not taking part in the current round of this debate because i have up till now had nothing new to add to it and to be frank  i didn t want to spend any more time on it  however since my name is coming up again i suppose i should say something  however guettarda has already said most of what i would say  so if you ve read his comments you already know most of my thoughts on the matter  i ll just comment on manning s point about the first editor s spelling policy usage  modern editors should bear in mind that  as manning says  spelling naming policy in those days was not quite the ironclad matter that it has now become  in fact the manual of style was originally someone s pet project initially following its precepts was optional  hence many of us only adopted its prescriptions as it became increasingly obvious that not to do so would cause friction with those who took it as gospel  so at that time we did occasionally move articles from one regional variation to another  for instance i moved british hoarding to american billboard where it still remains without any complaint from anyone about first contributor so  yes  first contributor is an excellent way to solve these types of dispute  however it wasn t always and isn t always applied as the hoarding billboard example demonstrates  talk ,0

 passion killing in namibia introduction  in the cambridge advance learner s dictionary  passion is defined as a very powerful feeling  for example of  sex  attraction  love hate anger or other emotions and killing is defined as the act of murder  in this context passion killing is combined passion killing can be defined as the act of killing someone out of the feeling of extreme anger  love hate  or other emotions in the past passion killing in namibia was very minimal but now the number has gone up and it has become a trend  recently  a large number of continuous passion killing cases have been reported  so far it is only men that have been reported to have murdered women  breakups and infidelities being of the main reasons amongst many in this article i m going to contemplate and discuss the causes of this aggravated passion killing in our society  who is at fault and recommendations as to what can be done to stop this type of violence the causes the question on everyone s lips is  why are men killing women amongst many causes  the most popular causes of passion killing reported have usually followed from women who depend on men for financial support  for things such as accommodation  tuition fees in a case of a student  food  clothes and other essential basic needs and in this case  men tend to become possessive and feel they own the women and when women call it quits  the men usually feels betrayed and sour and end up killing the women the namibian namibian another major cause that leads to passion killing in our society is infidelity from women  when a woman cheats and the men finds out  the feeling of betrayal usually overpowers the man and they end up killing  a possible cause could be the lack of self control and lack of respect towards women causes  who is at fault  as i have observed  both men and women are to be blamed in different cases firstly  certain men are at fault are because they don t seem to understand the real meaning of love  the country should cry out for help  true love is patient  love is kind it does not envy  it does not boast  it is not proud  it is not rude  it is not self seeking  it is not easily angered  it keeps no record of wrongs  love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth  love always protects  always trusts  always hopes  always perseveres bishop kleopas dumeni even if love is not involved  as it is in some cases  one would often feel that their ego is bruised or that their money has gone down the drain because they felt they had invested in something that they can own as property in other cases men tend to become desperate for love and affection and end up offering material things and money to women to get some sort of affection even though the women have not demanded for it  in the end they feel they own the women and when they cheat or end the relationship they result to killing  women are at fault in cases such as when they do not work hard to be independent and they accept all this material things because they want a chance at a luxurious and easy life at little to no cost  but little do they know that they might up paying with their lives when they do not stick to the person who is supplying with them with this sort of life  women or both men and women are also at fault because they enter or initiate relationships for the wrong reasons  be it for money or sex and soon and in the end the differences start to surface  then there are misunderstandings and pain to one or both parties either way there are many different cases regarding passion killing and in  different cases either sexes are at fault but this still does not justify passion killing recommendations recommendations  the solution to this problem is a hard one to solve because it would require some sort of reaching out to the people of this nation  knowing the diversity of people  it s hard to figure out what would impact certain people never the less  the nation cannot sit back and watch this type of evil carry on  informante a number of people have come up with reinforcing the death penalty  but i believe one cannot fix another evil with evil so what is the exact answer to the problem  should we bring back the death penalty  will it stop the passion killings ,0
 but none of them are for lane splitting  there are none  xero  nada  zip zilch no laws in california against lane splitting  the fact that a chippy can cite you for unsafe speed  reckless driving  w hate ver does not have anything to do with lane splitting  it means you are guilty of breaking some other law  but they cannot give you a ticket for lane splitting becasue it is not illegal  and it doesn t matter what pat honey has to say  his claim that this is a grey area is patently wrong  if you want to take his word over that of the dmv and chp  then you are less than analytically astute  therefore  ergo  w hate ver  this section does not belong in that article because what it says is a lie  driving unsafely lane splitting  can you figure that out unless you think wikipedia should be full of lies because someone you approve of says so sun rotates around the earth  eh the church tried that several times  i thought wikipedia was supposed to be about fact i am now going back to get rid of that section because it is a lie  lane splitting is not a grey area in california  according to the state of california  the state of california is a higher authority on their own laws than patty hahn  sorry ,0

 the press is free and will print what the hell they want the first proposition is dubious  what presses  set fit to print  is often a calculated judgement on  what the owners prefer  what advertisers on them won t object to  and what the readership that buys the paper would prefer to read  as one sees at critical moments  in the times of london  or the new york times  reportage can be devastatingly skewed  this goes for the mainstream press  the second proposition has nothing to do with either comprehensiveness or accuracy of reportage  but rather  who cares  i like it  i want the readership to think this way the murdoch press is a prime  and notorious example  it s old book  but written by walter lippmann  public opinion freely downloadable but is trenchantly eloquent on ther  pseudo environment  in which we are constrained to live by exposure to media analysis of the nature of news and of the economic basis of journalism seems to show that the newspapers necessarily and inevitably reflect  and therefore  in greater or lesser measure  intensify  the defective organization of public opinion this is what a great humane  liberal newspaper man could write about what really occurs in media  at the time  that was a centrist adminission of how much bull shit  is flogged to a gullible public to  manufacture consent  at w hate ver price to the facts  his position is held today by noam chomsky  whom lippmann s heirs regard as a dangerous man  in short  the classical moderate realist view of how information is cut and tailored to produce a social mindset is now only retained by those whom modern day centrists call extremists end of new year lecture ,0

the  arguments  above consist of reiteration  i also disagree that there are significant differences between anime and animation  certainly the latter covers a far wider stylistic range and anime could be described as a subset derived from the development of particular forms of mass production  which are also found in animation from other countries  whether the usa  korea  or anywhere else making significant amounts for the mass market this definition would exclude miyazaki  who  indeed  excludes himself  unlike his western fans likewise men in monster suits and miniature work are hardly unique to a particular national tradition  yes  the ultraman tradition represents as much of a speciality as marvel dc superheroes  and certainly deserves a specific article  but this is not the same as tokusatu  ergo  tokusatu is not a genre  should not be so quick to assume what people do and don t know about  my original comment may have been sharp but was in response to an i will not be questioned tone  and i certainly know enough to contribute to this article  however  i strongly disagree with the classification and crufty tone and thus won t  usage on the japanese wikipedia does not have any bearing  the large number of separate articles on japan related topics that could well be included under the more general headings is definitely a fan driven form of exceptionalism ,0
